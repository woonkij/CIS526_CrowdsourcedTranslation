If America wants to save its credibility in the world, then it should desist from supporting Israel and being an accomplice in its crimes.	The observers say that the American President has started making efforts to save the falling reputation of America on the international level, but it is very difficult for him to succeed in it, because as long as America is supporting the predator government of Israel, nothing good can be expected from her. If America wants to save its reputation, then it has to withdraw from supporting Israel and should not participate in her crimes.	According to analysts, the American president has started attempts to save America's falling image on the global level but it is difficult for him to be successful in this task. As long as America continues to support the murderous regime in Israel, one cannot expect anything good of it. If the America wants to save its image, it should keep itself away from supporting Israel and should not become part of its crimes.	Analysts are of the view that the efforts of the US President are aimed at saving America's deteriorating image in the world, but it will be extremely difficult for him to succeed in this task, because as long as the US continues to support the oppressive Israeli regime, nothing good can come of it. If the United States wants to save its reputation in the international community, it will have to end its support of Israel and refuse to be a partner in its crimes.	It is the saying of soothsayers that the American president started to save the falling goodwill of America at world level but his success is difficult due to helping blooding govt. of Israel therefor any good deed is not expected in this helping and if America want to save his goodwill then it should stop helping Israel and must not participate in the criminals of Israel.	Experts say that is daunting task for obama to restore the international image of US. To obtain its lost credibility, American has to review its pro-Israel policies.	Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.	Observers say that American President has started the struggle to strengthen the reducing cadre of America on International level but his success rate is very low as till the time America supports the brutal government of Israel nothing good is expected from America. If America wishes to raise his cadre in the world then she must back off from Israel support and must not participate in her crimes.	a353ocl6lm6m4o	a2de039cxxjuga	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a8v7wa74iohz9

For example, when a thief attempts a theft, and at that time he gets a feeling that 'theft is not a good thing and it is a curse and involves punishment and he fears God' then he will not commit theft	For instance, when a thief sets out to commit a theft but realizes in time that 'theft is not good; it is a curse; he will be punished and he also fears God', then he won't commit theft.	For example, if a thief realizes that theft is a bad habit and a curse, and that it brings punishment and the wrath of God, then this realization will serve as an effective deterrent for him, and he will not proceed with his plan of theft.	For example if a thief goes to perform a crime but just before he commits it he realizes that its a wrong thing to do and that robbing is a sin and that it is punishable so if he fears his Lord he will then not commit the crime.	For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.	As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.	If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.	a21xirv18up71h	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a28z6a8uc4er3x	a3kwcqj39dxkt4

The incidence of the hanging corpse and books titled "What Will Happen After Death" produce fear and terror.	The religious scholars since the truly dictatorial regime of dictator of the world Zia-ul-Haq, contrary to projecting God's attributes of kindness and affection, have been creating an atmosphere of fear and terror by telling countless stories of punishments and admonitions in the name of religion, in which the incident of hanging dead bodies and additionally their literature and books like 'What will happen after death' are also creating fear and terror.	Since the era of true dictatorship of Zia-ul-Haq, the Mullahism has been creating such an atmosphere of fear and terror in the name of religion by its descriptions of the various kinds of exemplary punishments and torture rather than highlighting the mercy and love of God. Besides, the incident of hanging of the corpse, their literature and books like 'What will Happen after the Death' strike terror in the hearts.	Since the time of the dictator Ziaul Haq, who was the real dictator, Mullahism has been reminding us about different types of punishments and telling wise stories in the name of religion, creating an atmosphere of terror. Instead they should have highlighted qualities of God such as mercy. Incidents like hanging dead bodies (on trees) and their literature, like the book titled "What will happen after death?," also create a sense of terror and fear.	instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.	Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.	Malaiat, In the period of The dictator of the time Zia-u-Lhaq he did not show good characteristics of sympathies of Allah but there is various tortures at the name of religion and more it his writing "What will be done after death."	ملائيت ضياءالحق his career, is now that you're امريت to God, the qualities of rahimi and karimi to highlight the contrary to the and the name of the religion of the ودہشت fear the atmosphere is set up in this incident, the body apart from their and ' 'after' will be severe also fear giving birth to.	a1wyssw33m2fz2	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a353ocl6lm6m4o	alrghxunh1uv7

The circumstances indicate that the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan during General Zia-ul-Haq's regime and resistance thereof by the armed groups formed by funding from America and Saudi Arabia cannot be eliminated now, and any efforts to take Pakistan back to the pre-nineteen hundred &amp; eighty position by trying to do this have not been successful.	The conditions reveal that the attempts to take Pakistan back to pre-nineteen hundred &amp; eighty position by dismantling the armed groups that were formed during general Zia-ul-Haq's era as a result of former Soviet Union's intervention into Afghanistan and the consequent Saudi and American funded resistance, have not succeeded.	The situation dictates that Pakistan could not attain a pre-80s General Zia-ul-haq regime type of situation by disarming those who are a product of a conflict created by the former Soviet Union's invasion of Afghanistan and America-Saudi funded armed groups.	The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.	The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.	It is clear from the circumstances that efforts remain unsuccessful to dislodge the armed groups funded by Americans and Saudis during afghan war. It means efforts to restore Pre-80's Pakistan are fruitless.	It is revealed that during the reign of General Zia ul Huq because of the invasion of the ex USSR in Afghanistan and its resistance started by the American and Saudi funding resulted in the birth of armed groups of which Pakistan unable to terminated could not get back herself to the era before 1980s.	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a353ocl6lm6m4o	a2de039cxxjuga	a8v7wa74iohz9

But the sad part is that if such a situation had been prevailing in some city of the Frontier, the government would have crushed it.

But the contradiction is if such a situation occurs in a border area, the government leaves no stone unturned to curb it, but if the same happens in a city and not a border area, the government looks helpless.	but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.	And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.	But what is sad the most is if this kind of situation occurred in some city of Sarhad, government would have done what not but now when it is not in Sarhad, the government is so helpless.	But if these circumstances occured in any city of N.W.F.P,then govt. had to do anything against it using all of it's resources but the govt. seems to be helpless when this is not in N.W.F.P.	a143bvgouf83je	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a1wyssw33m2fz2	a1u0z1mafqeh9y

As far your question is concerned, instead of bringing the widow to his home, if the gentleman had gone to the widow's home, the relatives would have become quiet after making some formal hue and cry (but this would have disturbed the stomachs of the widow's relatives).	As far as your question is concerned, had the old man shifted to the widow's house after marriage rather than bringing her home, his heirs would have made token protests and then gone quiet and content (the heirs of the widow would then have had butterflies in their stomachs).	As far as your question is concerned, then Mister, why do you bring a widow home? Instead, you should be going to her house so that the relatives keep quiet after creating artificial havoc (well, there will be a stomach ache in the widow's family).	And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)	now your Question is, if the big brother rather bringing the widow to his home, he might have went to her home itself, then there will no querrals from his children, (they quarrel may be in the widows children)	As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).

Terming a man's second marriage as immoral, divorce a sign of shame, a divorced woman as an untouchable, love marriage as a sign of disrespect and a man marrying a woman of higher age as the cleverness of woman, is a result of this way of thinking.	To consider the second marriage of a man as livid, divorce as a stigma, a divorced woman as an untouchable, love marriage as a shameful act, and the marriage of a younger man with an older woman as a sign of her wickedness are the results of this particular mindset.	Because of this pattern of thinking, we consider a second marriage of a male as bad, divorce as a blot, divorcee women an untouchable, marriage of one's choice as a stain on one's honor, and marriage of a man with an aged woman is considered a deceitful tactics of the woman.	Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.	The second marriage of a man is bad, Divorce is known to be bad, The divorced women is a untouchability sin, love marriage is the bad impression, the marriage of a man with a elder woman is said to be the evil plan of the woman. the above things are of such evil thinkings	Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.	Second marriage of man as ridiculous, divorce as stigma, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as disgrace and man's marriage with an elder woman as the result of her cunningness is all because of such thinking.	a1wyssw33m2fz2	ayowrg5s0py3f	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a8v7wa74iohz9
