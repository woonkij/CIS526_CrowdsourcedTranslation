Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good.

Observers say that American President has started the struggle to strengthen the reducing cadre of America on International level but his success rate is very low as till the time America supports the brutal government of Israel nothing good is expected from America.

Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.	Unless this feeling does not emerge in Human that what is right and wrong till then Human will keep doing mistakes.	It is a human mistake of doing wrong by not doing what is right.	a21xirv18up71h	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a28z6a8uc4er3x	a3kwcqj39dxkt4

For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.	As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.	If a thief robs a place, then he is in danger to rob the same place and same time tomorrow as well. If he fears god and man, he will not steal.	a21xirv18up71h	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a28z6a8uc4er3x	a3kwcqj39dxkt4

Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.	Same like this that unless Israel do not gets this apprehension that i am doing wrong and draining blood of innocents and i will get punishment for this, he will keep playing Holi with the blood innocents of Gaza till then.	Similarly, Israel should realised that it is a wrong thing to have bloodshed in Gaza.	a21xirv18up71h	a3dd3acpmvdvca	a28z6a8uc4er3x	a3kwcqj39dxkt4

Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.	Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi.
