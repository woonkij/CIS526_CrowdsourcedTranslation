How many sentences (with all reference sentences visible) are we going to provide for train purposes?
1. We mentioned we will give 358 sentences; but this may include the header.
	-> Why not give 358 actual train sentences, and 1 header such that the entire line numbers would be 359?


2. The division of the files
Let's divide the translations.tsv file into the following way:
	A. train_translations.tsv: (Contains all reference data, and 358 sentences + 1 header; so total 359 lines)
	B. test_translations.tsv: (Contains SegID, Urdu, Turk_Translation_1, Turk_Translation_2, Turk_Translation_3, Turk_Translation_4, WorkerID_1, WorkerID_2, WorkerID_3, WorkerID_4)
