Extension2 adds additional features to improve the baseline model, which used worker-level features only. Using the language model provided in Homework 2, I added the log probability of each translated sentence as a feature. Following Zaidan and Callison-Burch, I also added the ratio of the length of each translated sentence to the average length of the reference sentences, and vice versa, as a pair of sentence-level features. (The intuition is that good translations are likely to have similar length to the reference sentences.) As before, the labels for supervised training were obtained by computing the index of the best translation sentence, i.e., the one with the highest average BLEU score against the set of reference sentences. Using only these additional features, the same Random Forest classifier (with 150 trees) performed significantly better than the baseline, achieving a score of 0.543.
