'first nuclear experiment was done in 1990'
Thomas Reid who has worked in the Lever national laboratory of America as a Weapon designer, has written this book with the help of the Ex director of technical intelligence at Las Elmos national laboratory, Dani Stillman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
in an interview with US news, Thomas Reid said that in 1990 during Benazir Bhutto's rule, China experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.
he further added that this was the reason that in 1998 only in a span of two weeks and three days, Pakistan was able to carry out nuclear experiments as a reply to Indian nuclear experiments.
Thomas Reid reminded that in 1961 Russia suddenly carried out a nuclear experiment and besides possessing the bomb for a long time, it took 17 days for America to carry out nuclear experiment.
He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we also believe that Israel also has access to the results of this testing.
Thomas Reid was also asked about China's nuclear distribution program which is going on.
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.
Apart from this, China provided Iran with the nuclear enrichment plant in Kheraj.
He said that China has been providing Iran, Syria, Pakistan, Egypt and Libya with nuclear technology through North Korea.

Protest against the siding of Journalists.
On Tuesday the organization of journalists, RIUJ held protests in front of the Islamabad Press Club of journalists and newspaper workers against media owners and the government about the news channel and newspapers removing many of their employees.
Speaking to the protesters, senior member of Pakistan's biggest journalist organization, Federal Union of Journalists, C.R.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
according to Brussels' official stance, the efforts of Schwarzenberg delegation or Sarkozy were equally helpful in this regard.
European Union's spokesman Amadeu Altafaj has said that every such effort is adorable which is helpful in sending the European Union's message to the opponents of the war.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
as the head of the Union, Czech republic's role is even weaker than before.
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
the most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
he is part of a delegation which is headed by the foreign minister of Czech republic Schwarzenberg.
the problem is that both foreign ministers are issuing contradictory statements over the Middle East war.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial Crisis: Suicide of a billionaire German industrialist.
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
Financial institutions then refused to give it the new 700 to one Billion Euro loan it needed on an immediate basis, so Merkle went into deep pressure.
Some time before that, the same bank was prepared to give it the immediate loan that it needed, but Adolf Merkel had got to this position from being a small producer, to having a yearly turnover of nearly 30 billion Euros, so he could not bear to lose his capitalistic powet.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Merkel, banks have sanctioned 400 million Euros in floating loans for his group, but under the condition that VEM will have to sell Ratiopharm so that it could improve its financial conditions in the long term.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.
Crime rate among the immigrants in Germany.
According to the fresh statistics, crime rate among the immigrants from 2004 to 2007 is
Reduced from 9.22%
to 4.21%
According to Joachim Herrmann, the interior minister of Baweria province, this is apparently a positive change.
He said: "It is important to note that the number of foreigners getting German citizenship is increasing.
Therefore this should also be mentioned in the statistics that even though the criminal is German but his background is foreign.
Herrmann said that his province will take this in to account when gathering statistics in 2010.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.
Senator for foreign affairs from CDU, Christoph Ahlhaus has said: "When research is done in a scientific manner, the man can not pre-decide its results but it is based on the facts and figures that come out as a result of the research.
Ahlhaus diverted the attention to a research report from the anti crime's provincial office which was prepared in 2006 and according to this report in Bergdorf, a part of Hamberg, it was investigated that out of all crimes happening there what percentage have the involvement of foreigners.
results showed that the foreigners here have
the crime rate was less as compared to the crimes allover the province.
in contrast when in 2006 a survey was done on crimes in youth in Berlin, it came up that young people having foreign background had a percentage of .44
was 7 percent
However, other political parties of Germany for example, SPD, Environmentalists organization Greens, and leftist organization Linkspartei were against this proposal that while collecting facts and figures regarding crimes, this should also be inquired that which German citizen has a foreign background.

Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.

Tea: an effective cure for breast cancer
According to a new research, three cups of tea a day,
if taken, can decrease the risk of cancer in women below 50 years of age, by more than a third.
In a research carried out by the Moffitt Cancer Institute, in the American state of Florida, it was revealed that the risk of occurrence of breast cancer tumors, in such women below the age of 50 years
who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It was also revealed in the research that there was no significant benefit, in these regards, in the woman aged above 50, who drank three or more cups of tea a day.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
in the Moft Cancer Center situated in Tampa city of the State of Florida, a research was carried out on 5 thousand women who had taken the treatment for breast cancer.
Their ages were between 20 and 70 years.
the experts compared their medical record and life pattern with that of women who were safe from breast cancer.
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that by taking at least three cups a day regularly, the danger of breast cancer can be reduced in young women.
they say that making tea a regular drink in daily life can cause great resistance in the body against breast cancer.
in Britain, every year, almost 40 thousand women are diagnosed to have breast cancer.

why reduce exercise with the age?
new research
exercise at any age is good for health.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
unfortunately the ability to exercise reduces in many people with the age.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
According to the American Medical Association, several health related problems can arise by not doing exercise.
Dr. Pattricia P. Leka of Maya clinic Minnesota says that increase in age is a big reason for being handicapped from exercise and less physical activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which heart's activity of pumping blood and its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They came to know that with increase in age, problems increase in the relaxation action of heart.
Dr. Patricia says with increase in age, problems occur in the activity of relaxation of heart and with increase in age, this effects the ability to exercise.
Dr. Garvin Ken was part of this research
He says that we were surprised to see that it has an effect and it confirmed that bad exercising ability is very much related to the heart relaxing activity.
some times blood pressure can cause disorders in heart's functions and heart diseases.
if the doctor and the patient work in tandem in this regard, then they can take advantage of the benefits of exercise even with the age.
a detailed report in this matter is published in a magazine of American Medical Association.
There are no chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army Chief.
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, they are always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation, that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the terrorists structure is not only just the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
He said this in an interview to journalists in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day trip to the Kashmir valley to inspect the situation of the overall security situation in Kashmir, which is under New Delhi's management and to check the preparations of the armed forces at the border.
He was asked as to what his reaction was to the media reports which state that Pakistan refuted the proof presented by India, about the Mumbai attacks.
He stated that the matters of peace and war are decided by the political leadership.
Mentioning the proven presence of a terrorism structure in Pakistan, he said that the Indian army would face such groups which are trying to disturb peace and are bent upon weakening India.
He said that in Indian Kashmir, at least 700 to 800 militants are present, of which approximately half are foreigners.

He refuted the possibility of decrease in the army posting in Kashmir, saying that there can be no compromise with regards to national security.
May God bring people's dialogue pleasantness and bring Barack as blessing to world
Well there is no hope but see what Pakistan-America relationship brings to us in the result of this change
Thats the Wish of martin the king human right activist, who wnated to make the world a peaceful place
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for himself, but also for all the people who supported him.
It will even be a test for the white majority, as for them to accept from their hearts, a black governing over them is no easy task.
Here in South Asia, specially the Muslims which have some expectations from Obama, should remember that Obama has been elected the president of America. Obama also should remember that practically America is the president of whole world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
People who love him, have to have unreal expectations from him.
If Obama succeeds to an extent in reducing the hatred among races and religion in the world, so this will be a win for people who love him.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

Dear, whether it is Obama or some one else, the decision of the policy of the entire world is done by Jews lobby of billionaires, influencing, powerful and effective people.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
He handed over administration of Swat to Pakistan under a pact
but it is matter of sorrow that our government treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
and no interest was taken in the building and development works
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than those who used to get educated in the previous era.
In the Frontier Province, there is a continuous targeting of educational institutions by Taliban's.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
It is not just this, the Taliban has imposed a ban on girl education.
Thousands of male and female students have been deprived from getting education.
What do you think the Taliban have to gain by eradicating female education?
Why has the government been unsuccessful in stopping these illegal steps?
What do you think the government should do?
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
Because the public of Swat have realized this was a game, and that the army was there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them. Otherwise, how could five schools be blown up in a single curfew night? How could people be slaughtered during curfew and hung in the main circle of the town?
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
Now, the question arises, as to when the government has an armed military, new and dangerous weapons, new technology and spy system etc., then why are these four Taliban not being controlled?
The answer to this is that they have the hand of a hidden guide on their heads, because of which neither do their weapons get exhausted, nor do they get captured.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the situation has changed but the war is still going on and those supporting them in Pakistan are still Russia, India and Iran.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
For instance, when a thief goes to steal something, if he realizes at that time that stealing is wrong, it is a curse and it will bring punishment, and he fears Allah, that person will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That is, to struggle character wise and politically, more than in an armed manner.
From the Kashmiris taking part in the elections, it looks as if they have accepted this view point.
It is the third week of Israeli attacks on Gaza and the number of deaths have gone close to a thousand.
Despite worldwide diplomatic efforts, to date, a ceasefire was not possible.
According to another report, since the start of attacks, on the 27th of December, 90,000 Palestinians have left their homes and moved towards safer locations.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should happen?
how is permanent peace possible in Gaza?

Give Taliban a Chance.
Basit, Peshawar
Wake up! If Taliban starts the real Jihad, who will slaughter innocent people?
Who will burn down girls schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.
Pushtun force
Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just warns Israel of attacking it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America will get hurt.
And not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire, there will also be an actual ceasefire.
But what can be done, where can our leaders get so much courage from?
Someone should tell Ahmedinejad that he should take the lead, as BBC forum's are full of discussion of your braveness.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights falls not only upon the Arabs, or the Muslims of the world, but rather it is the duty of all the nations in the world that they speak up against oppression.
This troubling incident is one of the worst misdeeds of Bush yet.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
On one hand, America says that it will try for a ceasefire.
On the other side, the United Nation is passing one resolution over another but both have done nothing practically, this means that united nation is also working to crush the Muslims.
All the Islamic Countries should cancel their membership of United Nations and they should lay the foundation of there own international organisation.
Many examples are in front of us, where only promises and resolutions of America and United Nations came forward but only the Muslims suffered.
What is the advantage of these actions when BBC does not have to print anything.
Now, where have the principles of general ism been buried,When the unrequired blood especially of the Muslims starts flowing, at that time the ghost of unbiased reporting starts riding over the BBC.
Otherwise portrays itself as flag bearer of righteousness.
Saying something from their side is a far away thing, they do not want even comments
from the Muslims.
The difference between you and Jews is that they call themselves Jews and Martyr the Muslims and people like you live among Muslims, by calling themselves Muslims, to Muslims
[syja786]
For a while, BBC forums have been making a certain point, sometimes while discussing suicide attacks and other times, terrorism in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
But, who is extremist, that you can easily figure out from the above comment.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at the helpless people facing the Israel bombings, if the heart does not cry tears of blood what coes it do?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
The conduct of both sides is misanthropist.
The action of the United Nations and the United States seem to be supporting the Israeli wrongdoings.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
What a forceful act, hit on the head, and do not allow to cry.
The medicines for the injured, the shroud and compensation for the dead are being given by the Arab rulers, and the question is,
Israeli attacks, what should happen?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should take immediate action against Israel.
such as stopping the sale of petrol to Europe and America, but unfortunately..
Salams to all sisters and brothers.
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
Which these power intoxicated elephants are not realizing.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Israel and Hamas should enter a truce so that the death and destruction can come to an end.
Mohammad Sarfaraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
Those who claim to love God, love the messenger and love their religion, loving mankind is a part of their faith.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
But those people who plan against the religion, there is the order to perform Jihad against them.
To fight them until they stop their plans, but this does definitely not mean that you wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
Brothers, the end result of killing innocent children is destruction.
But I would like to tell my friends that yesterday the Israelis did not have any place for shelter, but today they have become so strong that they do not listen to anyone. This is because the Jews are one.
They do not have Shia, Sunni. They are all just Jews, and they have made everything for development.
On the other hand, what is the state of the 55 Islamic countries?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
Point required is that all Muslim countries should get together and should make a plan against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better course of action than accepting Israel. Learn new technology and ways of success from them and let the world live in peace.
Muslims have great land and resources.
The need is correct usage.
First of all, the most tragic part is that Hammas and Alfatah could not be united.
The only reason to destroy great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin was to weaken the only nation fighting for Aqsa Mosque. And it was impossible until Yasir and Yasin were removed from the way.
The world is watching that how Palestine was falling down every second after the death of these two leaders.
And how this lobby of jews strengthened their target by every moment.
in 1974 a Pakistani prime minister was so worldly trusted that first time in the history he manged to gather all the Muslim leaders under one roof with hundred percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
Rather the incomplete mission (of forming a joint Islamic nation) will be advanced while still removing the differences between the Muslims?
this is that jinn which lap to Palestinian since more than half century
this jinn have many face.
many time this jinn on his some other face give a bad remarks for his own self to turn back worlds pressure and concentration.
and this jinn other face eating peoples in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
and this jinn have a big fear of Islam, as this jinn knows that when ever he pull out this only and only by Islam Muslims and Muslims complete religion and act of Islam pull out because history said that Islam put on right track many biggest Abujahal.
Israels fighter jets start bombarding on Gaza and lunched missile attacks from 27th of December.
in this attack more than three hundred resident died.
after air attack now Israeli tanks and bulletproof vehicles prepare completely to war through land and reached on Gaza boundary.
United Nations Security council on its emergency gathering through agreed statement ask for immediate stop of Violent activities from Israel and Palestinian.
although Israel official said that it will continue its action in Gaza until he believe that rockets attack end on Israel.
what is your suggestion about Israel it is right this action is for try to defense stability of Israel?
is international world do its part in this scenario?
does this intense action link to Israels upcoming next election?
is American newly elected president Barak Obama after take his position would any improvement in middle east?

Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
has said that the United Nations which apparently talks of Human rights and peace, but when it comes to grimness and coercion over Muslims the only words coming out of its mouth are that Hamas should stop the attacks. how long this hypocrisy will continue.
Why is so much oppression being done on the Muslims? If people such as America stop supporting these Jews, then Allah has declared that they will live the life of a disgraced people, and such people can never lead a proper life. So if the Americans have courage, let them stop their support, and then see what kind of life they get.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Oppression is oppression, that the more it's done the more it is erased.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who can tell who did terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And why is there no one to send a mourning message from anywhere?
I watched the progress of the Mumbai incident, as if my own house was on fire. The sorrow of humans can not be watched, and who can not see this sorrow? If only Muslims would think a bit, together.
How can words derogate the bodies strewn on the streets, helpless innocent faced people, injured and soaked in blood?
I feel like crying about the helplessness of Muslims, that on one side, people are dying in India, and the whole world is climbing onto Pakistan, without any proof and saying, take action or else we will.
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay, but no darkness, with God. That too, when this darkness comes to pass.
Danger to Israel, with America present, is a joke.
As for elections, there is no doubt, to gain public support, such actions will have to be taken for the sake of power, especially in a state like Israel. As for Barack Obama, history is witness that no American ruler has been able to go against the American policy and nor will they go. Whether the ruler is white or black, he is still a ruler.
It appears from the conversation of forum that everyone is grieved over Benazir death but as politician her mistakes are not forgotten.
It is debatable that Benazir died for democracy or for power.
If she sacrificed for democracy then why she left democracy in the dictatorship of Musharraf for 10 years till she got a deal and American clearance?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she assured about government and that she will be freed from trails.
The blames that are being laid down on historical figures and not addressed by anyone.
Sana Khan
As some things are over looked under these circumstances nothing can be done.
One more Kari
Ladies and gentlemen maybe due to studying the history in not only Pakistan but in its four friend nations and seven other nations, you find the arguments of Mr Psycho more appealing.
Tariq Ayyaz
Those who don't deserve such education shouldn't get it either.
The reflection of the pine in water never got to be green.
Britain never allowed the two to be united and always came up with a new Hindu Muslim conflict which was looked after by Sir Syed.
Psycho
How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have succeeded a lot!
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored thinking that nothing can be done about them. Just like a donkey does not become a scholar if you en wreathe him with books.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
if we talk of war then it will bring loss of humans from both sides.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all Mary Christmas to Mr. Bhana and to all the Christian brothers of the forum.
greeting to all friends of the Forum: Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, sister Sana, sister Shahida and Mr. Akram.
we do not want the flames of fire but flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
will war give solution to problems.
it will bless with fire and blood.
will give hunger and exigence.
therefore wise humans
its better to avoid war
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
the India-America relations have deepened and India knows that when the time comes, America will openly betray Pakistan.
this is also the old history of America.
in case of and Indian attack, America would get its goals and the expense would be on India as well.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
Indian efforts for achieving diplomatic and military benefits as a ransom for the Mumbai attacks are making it more clever that effected and that is why in contrast to the initial strict reaction the world community has relaxed its pressure now.
while ignoring India's unnecessary bobbery, the satisfaction of the United Nations and the appreciation from the Interpol chief over Pakistan's efforts is a "Side Effect" of India's overwhelming diplomacy.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this phony operation.
That day is not far when a resolution about Pakistan's military intervention will be passed by United Nations just like the bill which was passed against Jamat-ud-Dawah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favour.
And supposing there is a delay in the enactment of this resolution, then considering the example of America, a superpower will come forward to take over on its own resources.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Maybe he was not a revolutionist.
Like the deadbodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bugti, Doctor Najeebullah and thousands of other revolutionists have been subjected to dishonour at the hands of the enemy.
They command even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that it would be permissible for them, saying that if we are not there, beasts and wild people will come and capture the government.
Such actions of the so called Islam lovers, in the name of religion is extremely disagreeable.
The supporters of these fundamentalists can see the oppression of America, but instead of being sorry about such beastly actions, give it the name of tribal traditions, and clearly avoid it.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
I think the people of our army have joint these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are these people so brave that they take 50 or 70 people hostage and our army watches like an audience, with hand on hand.
They are also servants of Allah and so is the army.
It is very clear that there is fishy.
instead of promoting God's blessing and merciful nature, discussing various disastrous and lesson gaining occurrences to create an air of fear and terror in the name of religion was being seen. And besides the event of hanging the dead body, their literature and books like "what will happen after death" also create fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
Wiso!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
You yourself have become the reason of fear.
It comes as a surprise when it is said that this was not done by a Muslim.
We are either unaware of our history or we choose to not know about it.
Who burnt the closed door of the Prophet's daughter on the refusal of oath after the Prophet (PBUH) passed away and how took her husband by the rope in his neck?
Did they come from abroad?
was the attack of Yazid's forces on Medina not the act of Christians and the Jews?
without accepting reality neither the motives can be diminished nor correction can be made.
O' BBC please stop this dual-headed policy.
better than this topic the super hit title: Shoe-ing of Bush fair or unfair?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
this act is of American and Pakistani agencies and Peer Sahab is a victim of this conspiracy.
all discussions on this forum will now be anti Taliban since the secret agents have successfully joined Taliban and they are doing what can change the public opinion.
I would like to ask only this. What were the soldiers doing when the corpse was kept hanging throughout a day? were they sitting there to aim only the common people? It is said that Taliban hideouts were bombed and a woman and two kids were killed when a house was attacked.
Why? Didn't they come to know about this great tragedy?
Were they leisurely having fun, or not?
Let us fold our hands to you in a request. For God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler who watches over all of us.
Though the question raised from the B.B.C. is substandard, it could only be felt pity at the poor quality of the writers. For instance, nobody asked this. What were the 3000 soldiers camping at Swat doing ?
The helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought Taliban.
The cheating done to the commoners by the Pakistani soldiers is done, but, it is not right that the medias including B.B.C. has concealed the fact from the world.
The Pak soldiers are playing drama.
Every child in Swat whispers that it is a bloody drama.
Please stop this drama, for god sake
The Taliban has destroyed the name of muslims
if the pure muslims of whole worlds does tell them as a muslim, they wont get any place to leave for the terror
Those are not interested in doing work, and not interested in leaving a peaceful life, and they take guns and join those people
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
Shame on you
there is no reason for this in any religion or in any families
BBC along with other media's has gathered information about Taliban
but, the reality is not even known to any one, that what is the real situation, we only know because we are tribals
BAsically it is a game in which CIA, RAW, MOSAD, and our ISI,are involved, there is no one in from taliban or from tribal, the was created by terror from above agencies, who are insulting Taliban, Islam, Madarsa's, Pestos, and Tribals
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute the leader of MQM, Althaf Husain, and the leaderships of ANP and PPP, as they have spoken against this cancer, i.e. the Taliban.
This cancer was given birth to by Zia-ul-Haqq. He has gone, but he has destroyed Pakistan as he went.
But I have hope that the present government will eradicate this cancer.
After Mumbai attacks India said that some extremists are behind the attacks.
Pakistan rejecting the accusations said that it will help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Now Pakistan has said that included in the list Jaish-e-Muhammad's Molana Azhar Masood is not in custody and government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Before that the president of Pakistan Asif Ali Zardari refuted the view that west's secret agencies and Indian government has given evidence related to Mumbai attachs.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
At that time,Prime Minister Manmohan Singh warned Pakistan that their relationship with India could not improve as long as their land continues to be used for terrorism.
And in the latest developments, the Indian cricket team cancelled their tour of Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
What do you see the future of Indo-Pak relations looking like?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will break itself.
With so much regionalism, factionism and infiltration, what else can you expect?
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago
Madam, if work was continued in Jinnah's manner, neither would the tumors of regionalism, factionism and infiltration have spread in Pakistan, nor would the Indian Muslims been treated in this way.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
this region has great capabilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
and the evil powers don't want this region to progress therefore these countries are controlled like puppets.
can you imagine what status will this region of Pakistan, India and China will have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
may Allah protect our country from any harm, Amen.
but Sir, open your eyes to see the surrounding situation and ground reality, you will figure out how far American forces have penetrated.
moreover, the internal affairs don't seem to be good, as you can see the circumstances in NWFP, Balochistan and in Karachi in Sindh.
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah bestow your mercy upon us.
Account to my understanding, a final war is inevitable.
this is enough of it.
now it should be do or die.
this problem can not be solved through these acts of insincere dialogues.
and not through small scale terrorism in each other's country.
after all, Europe got settled after the final world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties agree on this matter that these terrorist and denominational activities should be terminated from the country.
But our army rule does not seem sincere in this matter. On one hand, American and Europe are made to believe that we are with you on this war against terrorism and the other hand, we also help Taliban secretly.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
Terrorist groups present in Pakistan, who support professional criminals and the heads of those Mullahs are those who call Pakistan the land of destruction and what not.
And now they are doing everything to destroy Pakistan.
In reality, they do not even deserve to be called Human beings, let alone Muslims.
Without cleaning Pakistan from these evil doers, the country's existence will be in jeopardy.
Can we still afford to think if we should ban these mutinous or not?
In this world of callous leaders, there is no place for those whose work is only to kill.
This news tore my heart.
What kind of world is that in which it has become difficult for those who even take the name of one of the important parts of the religion of Allah, Islam.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
After the Mumbai attacks, Indo-
Pak relationships turned sour, because of which the proximity between the two countries forming after many years, for the first time suffered a severe setback.
India has always claimed that militant and non-militant groups which are active in Pakistan were responsible.
For the relationships to return to normal, taking action against these countries is being made a prerequisite,
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
in this way many times Jamat Ul Dawa Names came up.
this was not first time that terrorism cause intense relation in between two countries.
on December 2001 after attack on Indian parliament this two neighbors came to the front of war.
and after put sanction against Luskaray Taiba and include it in a list of terrorist organizations.
now on Jamat UL Dawa , about which security analyst said that this is new face of Laskaray Taiba, asking for sanctions.
what is your suggestion should this group sanction or not?
Should Pakistan need to take action against terrorist group on its land?
does put sanction on Jamat Ul Dawa present India
Pak crisis could resolve and for real peace in between two countries how important is that to finished groups who have weapons?
United Nations Security Assembly put sanction against Jamat Ul Dawa, in last what evidence Security council have to shows that much hurry?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
If you look at it, even India has become an unsuccessful state.
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
To a non political, religious and social organisation of our dear country---
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
Muslims have also advanced in every field.
But when there was a rise of Mullaism in the religion, there was a division of people into Muslims and Kafirs, and new avenues of mischief were opened, which were not known to the world previously.
Do greet them sir. But at your own expense.
Don't do it under the pressure of America.
If India has any complaints, then it should come up with evidence.
Why don't they do so?
Why do they blame everything on us?
Extremist groups are also present in India, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorists in the world?
Who can India explain its actions in Kashmir?
and what of the actions of Israel?
The truth is that we are the first Nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamran Hassan, ABU DHABI
Your talk touches the heart and circumstances also seems to be such
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
American are not slowly but now very swiftly tightening there grip over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
More the terrorism is condemned lessor it is , whether it is in a Hotel at Mumbai or it is in Marriott Hotel Islamabad or it is in Palestine.
Like wise irrespective of the origin of the terrorist, these should be eliminated, no matter these are Pakistanis or Indian or American or Israelite.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Was the attack carried out on Marriott Hotel was not a terrorist attack?
Then why?
Hats off to Home Advisor, Mr. Rahman Malik. Masha Allah, he has become so brave and courageous.
?
Not only that, according to BBC, the mentioned Mr. Malik has vehemently disproved this belief that the arrest of terrorists were being done at the 'request of others'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
Having this capability or not, this I don't want to say.
Whose war we Pakistanis are fighting
and why. We have our own priorities which we shall protect with our full strength.
Nobody has an authority to interfere in any other country.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
If they trust America and the United republics, then let them leave the style of new populations, and let them work on those lines, upholding the sovereignty of the state.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
In Pakistan Occupied Kashmir, security forces captured a proved camp of practically non-existent Lashkar-e-Taiba.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Minister, Condoleeza Rice told the Pakistani leadership that there should be immediate action taken against the perpetrators of the Mumbai attack.
He said that the extremists whom attacked Mambae used Pakistani earth.
Meanwhile, the saying of Pashawar commanders is that unknown miltary persons fired the another point of United miltary truks and in result 50 miltary truks destroyed.
It is the second attack on NETO and America.
Meanwhile, Pakistan made the show of disactive party Lashkar-e-Taiba and before this was tried to make miltary persons unmiltary and miltary wepons were changed with money and cartainly no any action without it.
The situations told that in the past period of President ZiaulHaq the efforts of Pakistan to end of miltary parties in the result of enterance of Soviat Union in Afghanistan and the resistance by America funding did not succeed.
The question is this is Pakistan wants to do it?
Is Pakistan capable for this?
What do you say?

I have only one question for the standard bearers of the world.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And I ask you, does any science, from Islamic sciences to the sciences of the East and the West, any logic or philosophy, anywhere, give the permission to kill innocent public, including worshipers, laborers, and poor workers, in revenge for the American attacks?
If your answer is in negative, then you really need to fix your viewpoint.
The people were armed when there was the fear that Russia would head towards Pakistan after finishing Afghanistan, and that is why they were supplied arms.
Now, when there is the fear that America will capture Pakistan, via Afghanistan, as the president American president has clearly mentioned in his presidential mission, why should we disarm them now?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them are guilty of being involved in any destructive work, Pakistan can take action against them alone.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeebur Rahman Syco, Lahore
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
As for Lashkar-e-Taiba, the present terrorism is in no way connected to it.
It must be remembered that Hafiz Saeed is the first 'Jehadi leader' who called the Taliban actions 'mischief'.
I am sure that the Taliban effect is a inseparable result of American plans, and hence every person who can stand in the way of Taliban must be removed.
Despite the support of the whole nation, the fact that Zardari and co. took action against the Lashkar is a clear sign of their frigid and kiss-up nature.
To stop the project that is running on Saudi-American funding, they must be requested themselves to regather, for God's sake, the filth that has polluted our society.
And also protest against them asking them based on what ethics, America and Saudi spread dangerous weapons and so called Jihadi, but in reality hate inciting and cultural virus enticing literature in our country, because of which our country has become a human slaughterhouse.
After facing the risk of attack from India, the Pakistani Army's announcement that it would remove forces from the Afghan border and post them at the Indian border, and the announcement of the Taliban that it would handle the Afghan border, caused America to stumble, and pressurize India not to attack Pakistan.
This showed the strength of America in the region.
Though India did not warn that they would attack, and nor do they have that much courage.
The Taliban attacked and finished most of the remaining American supplies.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they waant to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to the problem is that the Urdu speaking learn Pushto or the Pushto speaking learn Urdu, or its better that everybody learns English.
You must be thinking its a funny suggestion, but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of the torture would be language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir in my childhood I had actually given the same suggestion many times to my friends ,which included people from every religion and rhetoric groups, but my friend people used to laugh over these suggestions.
at that time, these rhetoric and religious differences were not that live and powerful but they were boiling inside.
its hard to understand that what is happening and why?
are these the signs of the judgement day?
what are these innocent and innoxious people being killed for?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
Where reaction full of patriotism of all political, religious, lingual and national parties have taught diplomatic manners to India, at the same time they have also given American planners one more chance to think.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, and the government is taking sides.
The government can control the situation in one hour, but it is purposely allowing it to grow.
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
until there is pressure on the administration, these kind of incidents will keep taking place.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
but alas that if these incidents were in any city of NWFP, then what would the government have done over there, but since its not in NWFP, the government seems to be helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
BBC Urdu is also not writing the truth under pressure and Pakistani media's condition is already weak.
the whole truth is there on BBC English.
one solution to the problem is that either Urdu speakers should learn Pushto or Pushto speaking learn Urdu or better if every body learns English.
you will definitely take is as a funny suggestion but don't you think the cause of the conflict is also funny?
that the cause of extremism be language?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
Wherever one could do something, he did everything. Reports on the media are 50% of what has happened here in four days.
Stayed awake in the last four nights and still afraid.
Who evacuated hotels, killed cobblers peanut sellers.
causing depredation on Super highway and cutting off ears of the innocents are all not aware of the punishment of Allah, which will catch them one day.
What do you think are the reasons for this sudden violence?
(BBC)
Keeping the heart rendering Mumbai attacks in view and diving to search for a cause for the violence in Karachi is not at all needed, rather the quite straightforward reason for this violence is the subconscious change in 'blood'.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
Liaquat ali khan and many Other freedom fighters belong to that. he was writing a poetry to remove Mr. Saiko Miss understanding.
we will again establish the old traditions
we gave Live for it and we gonna protect it by giving our lives.
Faizan Tausif Siddiqui
its very sad that whole country is on stake and we are still fighting each other
Mr. Siddiqui, in Wikipedia
we got to know that Liaquat Ali Khan was related to the province of Punjab, in the area of Karnal and belongs to a Punjabi Family
for his effort for Refugee, today Refugee consider him as there own
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
I'jaz A'wan
Sir, before you get a large number of people with proposals, I shall tell you that the open signs of this mischief is also found on the walls of Karachi, in the form of posters and wall chalking.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
There used to be one Muslim League (n), but they also made the rough version of the 18th amendment and handed it over to the Peoples Party.
Before that, MQM and Muslim League (q) had already handed in rough versions of the 18th amendment to the national assembly and senate.
It still seems that the copies of the 18th amendment is a political trickery, and no one is sincere about accepting that amendment.
This is why no fuss was made in the assembly or on the floor of senate over this amendment, and the parliament was not forced into accepting the amendment.
It looks as if the parties just wanted to get the thing off their backs by submitting the rough versions, so that tomorrow, they may say that we had submitted our versions of the amendment, but the government speaker did not take action.
MQM an ally of government, Muslim League (N) secret friend and Muslim League (Q) has approved the 17th amendment, then how is it possible that they are sincere in removing 17th amendment.
It is like painting red to be counted amongst martyred.
Peoples Party is not what so ever in a hurry to remove 17th amendment.
Nobody can think of cutting his own hands.
As long Zardari is President 17th amendment will be there.
It was majority's opinion in our one survey and a fact too.
If 17th amendment ought to be removed then Zardari wont become president.
Now he is more powerful then President Pervez as along with the President he is the Chairman of Peoples Party.
Till he is president 17th amendment is there.
For removing 17th amendment political parties has to depart President Zardari from President house first.
Neither MQM nor other parties want this.
In our family, most of the people are of the laborer type.
And in our childhood, when we used to see our uncles toil, we used to wish in our hearts that Allah save us from labor that is hard on the body.
To save ourselves from this, we wrote a letter to the editor of the Amroz daily, asking him what we can do after metric to save ourselves from having to toil.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
My focus was always on engineering, and after metric, instead of Biology, I took Technical Drawing.
But while entering the FSC, my elder brother forced me to do FSC in medicine and become a doctor.
I studied Biology for a month with great difficulty, and when I still could not understand anything, I took maths as a subject instead.
So the scare of having to work made me an engineer, and today I am in a very good condition compared to many of my same aged relatives, for which I am always thanking Allah.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"
We said, if that is true, then study a lot like us, and free yourself from bodily pain.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you do not even know what you have to do, then Allah alone is your protector.
There is a saying that never say bad for a dead but what to do, also at the first death anniversary of Benazeer we only see bad in her.
Benazeer for her own benefit forwarded to India the Sikhs' army, who were to fight the war of independent. On one side the independent movement of the Sikhs was collapsed and on the other side gave chance for India to concentrate on Kashmir after pushing down the Punjab movement.
It is the part of the distraction from the leadership of Benazeer and Nawaz Sharif which have pushed the country to many years backwards.
During exile Benazeer continued on keeping the series beneficiary information of Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Baenazir went against the pact made with Nawaz Shareef in London by making a deal with General Musharaf
During the time of Baenazir's leadership she gave an open hand policy to her family members to earn money, and due to this he got to be known as Mr 10 Percent.
In the time of Baenazir her brother got murdered, and his murderers are still at large.
Besides being a woman Baebnazir did not fight for the rights of women.
The way in which Baenazir did politics on her fathers dead body, in the same way her followers are doing politics on the dead bodies of her family.
Baenazir got to be a leader twice and in that time punishing her fathers murders at one side she didn't even file charges against them.
It is 37 years since East Pakistan was separated from us, and look at the height of insensitivity on the part of the public and the rulers, that no one ever mourned or expressed sorrow over their mistakes.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
We should have been sending greetings to the people of Bangladesh on this day and been trying to bring them closer to ourselves.
The ruler should have opened the Jamudur Rahman commission file and pondered over the causes of separation of West Pakistan, mentioned therein.
He would plan on bringing back the people of Bihar who were stuck in Bangladesh and he would send them gifts to keep their spirits up.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
A huge calamity can pass by, but the next day we are lost in our day-to-day routine of life.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can become one again, if we sacrifice a little for each other and leave our selfishness behind us.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
Today, when it was announced in the news that the governor of American state Illinois was caught on corruption charges
and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.
In America, no gigantic figure is beyond the law.
and there is your country Pakistan whose president has been elected after dropping of corruption charges.
my sense of humor woke and I said that what's wrong if a governor got arrested in America, in Pakistan, once we arrested the Prime Minister overnight and hanged him and the second time we exiled one.
tell me when it happened in America?
Pakistan sent off the lawbreaker with guard of honor from the presidency, tell me when did such thing happened it America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
Holder of a fake degree was made the minster for health in Pakistan, did it ever happen in America?
after hearing all this the American went down laughing and then conceded defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling even after being surrounded by Americans from all sides.
It seems from his smile
that America is with his government. But he is forgetting that last year the same people was with Parvez Musharaf.
This picture was passed on, as if it was of some family.
Previously, such a photo was never printed in newspapers before, i.e. one president with three American agents.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the rules of democracy are implemented on this photo, President Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
According to the government tactic so far, along with force, discussions have been going on.
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
It is required that the government finish the causes of this problem, rather than use force.
By finishing the causes, Fazlullah and the Taliban will be finished themselves.
The proposed Shariah bill of the ANP government will become a moderate solution to the problems in Swat.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
From General Musharraf's initial few steps, it looked as if the nation would be freed of useless politicians, but the love for power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
And whatever steps were expected were no more.
Just as Bush's rule began to close, he started to worry about the end of his own rule, and he struck a deal with thieves in the dark.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
The conditions in the terrorism struck area Swat in the Frontier Province are continuously deteriorating in spite of continuous Army action in the area
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
The result is that on the one side the government is not ready to accept its defeat and on the other hand the Taliban has established their hold.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said that in Swat somebody asked, which type of people are the Taliban's are? The answer was "very good people because they are the custodians of the religion and they are fighting a war against the enemies of the country".
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am astonished, how the Pakistan Army will fight with the Indian Army, while it is unable to control a small group of Taliban's.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfews are called so that the Taliban can move around easily.
During curfew tonight, eight trucks entered the outskirts of Mengorah and formed barriers.
The question arises as to how they got there despite the curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God's sake, can someone explain to the army to save the poor public from the grip of the Taliban and prove that the Army can defeat any enemy.
He says, maximum bloodshed has been done on the base of religion, you tell me in the absence of any religion wont bloodshed occur?
Punjabi, Pathan. white and black, Mehsud and other tribes, are all these created by religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I do not know why people only expect us to call.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
So that no other victim will even think about using a great damage causing weapon like a sling shot to fight for his rights?
Doesn't your hear ache even when a father is running holding his son's dead body?
If no, then you have no right to be called a human being.
But you are a shame to the name of humanity.
At least this was proven that this area was also Israel's country for thousands of years.
What should happen is that both the nations should live together happily and with love but since they are controlled by the west and arab countries, therefore peace can not be formed here with out their consent.
But even Iran wants to fight its proxy war here now.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
BBC's own country has its interests related to America and Israel and this is why while taking cover of enlightened moderation, it has started a series of blogs or Jewism and doing a biased propaganda.
BBC is just doing formality and to gain sympathy is their only purpose and wish!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thankyou.
who knows about the author and the origin of this story but the fact remains, in every era draculas have fed on innocent blood.
Every era has seen war as well as blood shed.
surprisingly twenty first century man who considers himself very civilized is silent over this murder done publically in the day light.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity

At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
These rains are also from you
which when fell brings spring.
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes it came just like that, without a reason.
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes loudly, sometimes silently.
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
on some suppressed ashes
Sometimes it was such, that the wind put it out.
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes each drop seems sorrowful.
Even these rains are from you.
All these rulers are going to run away carrying a suitcase. What is it to them, whether the country lasts or not.
Whether the public sells scrubs or takes lemon peels and scrubs the temple bells with them.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
As for the public, they are ignorant. To speak about them is the biggest ignorance.
Yesterday afternoon something surprising happened.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
and moreover that NYPD traffic was also not in a mood to look at illegal parked cars.
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till now it is just known this that "Terrorists" relation was with birds race Goose.
Yesterday was maybe New York's historic cold
Temperature do not drop to this degree
Me my own jaw is beginning to hurt after half hour of stroll outside.
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
and sad news is that ship of company sank in this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise, I had not taken the previous two exits, seeing the lines waiting at them.
Mekki: My Pakistan..! Good greetings. Eid Mubarak to you.
Umar: Ofcourse, Faithful.!
Shugfath: Good greetings..! Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
There was no other option. Otherwise, I would have to go to the farm
and prepare the meat, skin it off too.
Basam: Dot net could take a time to get right.
what happen on form?
Link.
listen to the blog to give fight back look on to Firefox.
Deafer: wish you, you too Eid Mubarak.
dear sir use Firefox.
ice will disappear.
For no reason, we thought that the Taliban group from Sawat was non religious, who were only against women education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
Swat, The Taliban has destroyed a boys school.
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Amen, then Amen.
Masha Allah, up till now, 182 schools have been destroyed.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
just a while before this, the wedding of a dog with a girl took place.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
This is the time of the computers and their role in our lives is ever increasing.
A lot of people have reservations on so much dependence on computers in our lives, specially in case of financial or monetary matters.
Where there are certain comforts by the use of credit cards on the other hand law enforcement agencies are also getting to know more about you.
That now with just looking at the credit card transactions record your whereabouts can be traced.
and when in the future the use of real paper money will get limited the benefits of plastic cards will increase more compared to today.
That is why now in crime it is preferred to steal credit card information rather than looting a bank.
Similarly computer has provided means for friendship or networking.
Social networking sites, like Orkut, Facebook and Myspace are at first level of acceptance.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
But can you lead a life with a person who is just like you?
I can not, and that is why the spouse is called the better half,
because he/she will get rid of the faults within me.
I guess i got a lesser part of intelligence
Since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
This is how I got to believe that dad has the answer to every question in the world.
People used to make a lot of jokes about me on this.
But only that seems true which can be possible.
It is very troubling, that what is the need to tell lies.
Even at this age, he was harmed by this.
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
And that I say Insha Allah (If God Wills) only when I am asking Allah to complete the work.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a despicable matter that arose due to distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their expenses are to be borne by the father, and the father can meet his children.
then when they become mature, they live with whom they wan to live.
You are right that the actual problem are the relatives who misguide.
feudalism has overshadowed our deeds.
Even here is thinking is prevailing that there will be more partners in father's property so it is resisted, although this act of the father is commendable should be imitated.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
concept of remarriage of a divorced or a widow is getting rare.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
I believe that this persons children should have thought what is wrong if he married a widow, after he married off all his children?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
As the children would definitely have gotten busy in their own worlds and would not be able to give time to him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
It is acceptable for a wife that her husband does unlawful actions but she does not let him marry another woman.
If its in her power, she will not let him do so even after she dies.
Destroys her afterlife along with her husbands'.And also lets spreading of the immorality in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For example, keeping girls from getting education and fear of love marriage.
And about your question, when sir instead of bringing his wife home, goes to someone else's wife so the dependents just make a fuss for the show and stay quiet and satisfied. ( yeah, later the relatives of the wife get angry)
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Considering man's 2nd marriage as ridiculous, divorce as denigration, divorced as untouchable, love marriage as dishonor and considering a man marrying an older women is dissimulation of the women is only the result of this way of thinking.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
Accepting Islam was easy, getting rid of this way of thinking is very hard.
Allah bless us with the ability and courage to do this task.
Ameen.
It was never that difficult to write Urdu.
It took century's to write this little.
Think of this less as a lot.
Good Bye.
Amir Taimoor Write on his book "i am Tamioor" thati have discovered secret in my life that if any force commander in chief on the first raw so that force never loss.
but that circumstances different there.
it was said lay folk die for our self we die so martyr.
if some one die form Lay folk so killed.
May Allah bless and have mercy on you.
When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought may be this man has forgotten his way or may be he wants to ask something. I stopped so his whole family was in his car.
He asked if I can understand Arabic very well or not. I said that there is no problem. You tell me what is the matter.
He started saying, I have come from Riyadh but here some one in Medina picked my pocket if you please help me. I said forget about it.Because this has happened with me earlier also as I gave this man 20 riyals to pay for gas and go back to Riyadh but he started doing the same thing after moving forward a little.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
So now this is the condition of us Muslims that even when we come to beg money, we come with families riding in cars and daily manage to get at least 2 to 3000.
Although there is an evident saying of the Prophet (P.B.U.H) that the hand above is better than the hand below and the hand above is the giving hand the lower is the taking hand.
Allah have mercy on us and make us true Muslims ( Amen)

The wife of famous singer Adnan Sami approached a Police Station in Mumbai, accusing him of torture.
The Police Station advised her to approach the court.
Saba Galadari the wife of Adnan Sami gave an application against her husband that Adnan Sami continuously tortures her
and he is also administering in human behavior against her.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
Police station has advised her to approach the court instead of registering the case, on the plea that the case is not within the valid jurisdiction of police station
Do you think that the accusation on Adnan Sami by his wife is correct?
Can this accusation is an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Inform us about your opinion on the Subject.
Adam Saanghar, stamp.
as far as blames concern so any man can do on other.
nothing more important than respect.
what so ever relation of present wife and Adnan Samih , Adnan Samih leave his respected life and went India to earn money, now this popularity made hurdle for him.
this is due to his own deed.
Washington.
high level American official said that president Obama made strong policy against Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
on this new policy of America about Afghanistan give more importance on War instead of Development.
Official said that Hamid Karzai consider as a hurdle in Afghanistan to get American Aid, because corruption in the government, intoxication business get increased and Taliban forces get regathered.
American official said that those people from American government who put pressure on Hamid Karzai to do more in which vice president Joe Biden and representative of Brack Obama for Afghanistan and Pakistan Richard Holbrooke included.
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
Officials say that the Obama government would work with the State leaders rather than the central government.
The officials say that it will pressurize Karzai to step up the war against corruption.
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
This statement of the American officials is not a precursor for a change in the American policy towards Afghanistan, is it?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
Pakistan had defeated Sri Lanka in the first match, but Sri Lanka was victorious in the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?
which departments of the game should be addressed more by the authorities?
are you satisfied with the selection of the team?
which department you will hold responsible for the defeat, fielding, batting or bowling?
please provide your feedback.
Malik Babar Hussain, Judah, it is very disappointing that even today these kind of heathenish traditions continue. these feudal lords target innocent people with their feudal rule, who would call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
when the judicial justice will come in handy.
Sri Lankan team has reached Pakistan to play one day series.
besides the Indo-Pak sullenness, a visit by a foreign team to Pakistan is very pleasing.
upon reaching the Karachi airport, the Srilankan team was very warmly welcomed.
two one days between Pakistan and Srilanka in Karachi whereas the third one day will be played in Lahore.
both teams have there claims over bowling, batting and fielding.
if the Srilankans are proud of their spinners, the Pakistanis trust their fast bowlers.
Srilankan Captain Mahela Jayvardena has said that not a single player from Pakistan team but the whole team is dangerous.

this all those same people have responsible, Kashmirs fighting for there freedom since last 60 years.
no one ask about that now they have stuck with fundamentalism and fight for terrorism so they now start talking about deal.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
although Pakistan have to understand there two way policy.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating this situation to distract world attention away from Kashmir issue.
But Pakistan has always showed true face of India to the world
Now British government has realized that Indian government is maligning Pakistan for terrorism so that it can occupy Kashmir.
They are unwilling to talk with Pakistan on this matter
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
it should be clear that the newly elected American president Obama has also expressed similar views over the Kashmir dispute.
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Milliband has said that Pakistan should not be lenient with the extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Is India using terrorism as a base to escape from comprehensive dialog?

Usman Aftab,
I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
Rather it wants to keep it in check, and hence is thinking of taking certain steps. They know that Pakistan is a nuclear state.
They want to bring about some kind of revolution here.
Foreign countries are only thinking that if they corner Pakistan, they would face some political and geographic problems. They want to help Pakistan, but also want to be successful in their goal.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get stomach aches over small issues and begin to warn Pakistan.
Indian army cheif keep your mouth shut,any way we are ready orelse we know to give you a solid answer.
Faheem Siddiqi
Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
The Prime Minister said that Qadeer's door was closed.
In your opinion, do the public protests against Mina Marriot not mean anything?
Has the lawyers movement not played any role?
What do you have to say about this statement of the Prime Minister?
Make us aware about your opinion.
American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
'I did, as a president, whatever I felt was appropriate, according to the situation, and the American law and constitution, giving preference to American interest over my own acceptance'.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
Did Bush delay accepting his mistake?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

America is ambitious on the arrest of Usama and the search of Usama is on.
Will Dick Cheney's wish of arresting Usama be accomplished?

Zubeer Khan, Karachi
This is very hurtful incident that Israel is publicly massacring the Palestinians, same situation is here in Kashmir but Security Council do not even bother by it.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks still continues in Gaza, since now several Palestinian Men, Women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
There meeting of Security Council ended without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why are the important Islamic countries quiet?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York
I think that actually, most of our people are illiterate. They do not know where their money is going. The government fixes taxes and likes to fulfill its duties, the electricity and gas crisis will not be like this.
Because everyone knows the role of those selected by the people.
The electricity and gas crisis across Pakistan has taken a serious position.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Among the manufacturing and business circles, there are strong protests and severe reactions going on, to the long power cut and gas crisis.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government department are playing a blame game on each other
isn't under these circumstance the proposals for increasing electricity and gas tariff a joke with the people?
Why is attention not being given in resolving the issues?
Can the government see the failing of the country's economy?
To counter these problems for the short term, what suggestions do u have?
Please inform us about your opinion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that they are giving difficulty to the public who called for a democratic government.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
There is no control over government institutions.
The law and order situation is getting worse, day to day. May Allah have mercy on this country.
The New Year started.
The previous year was a year of protests and political ups and downs. It will also be remembered for terrorism.
The removal of President Musharraf from power, and President Bush's eight year regime coming to an end, Bush getting shoes thrown at and the establishment of a democratic government in Pakistan, sudden calamities, the earthquake of Balochistan, the global financial crisis and depression.
Now a new year has arrived, how do you see the new year?
According to you, what color will the political and geographic scenario take, and what wise steps will Obama implement?
Is there any hope of moving towards eradication of terrorism?
will the judicial crisis in Pakistan come to an end?

what are you expectation from the new year?

After ruling over America for eight years, President Bush left the White House, for presidential camp office, Camp David, so that the White House can be decorated and prepared for new President Barack Obama, according to his wishes.
In Bush's eight year presidency, the historic World Trade Center attack, the attack on the Pentagon, the action against Afghanistan and Iraq in the name of a global war against terrorism, in which armies of many countries were pulled into the war, and American resources were completely exhausted, were some of the memorable events of the Bush era.
As a result of this war, America had to face the worst economic and financial crisis in history.
What do you think the world got and what do you think they lost, as a result of this war?
Were the policies of President Bush successful?
What are your views of the Bush era?
The Indian government has stopped the Indian cricket team from touring Pakistan.
The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.
Rajiv Shekhla, the Vice President of the Indian Cricket Board, in an interview with Jeev News said that the board had asked the government for permission to go on the Pakistan tour, but due to the difficult situation in the two countries, the tour was not possible.
Is the Indian government's decision to cancel the trip in view of the present political situation a proper step? Should sports not be separated from politics?
Is the Indian government's decision not harmful for cricket?
Despite the fact that the security condition in India is bad, the England cricket team is continuing its tour, so why can't the Indian team make the tour of Pakistan?
What is your opinion on this?
Salman, Karachi
Those people who are proud about going to India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami, in which he said that he is not Pakistani, rather, his citizenship is of England.
Adnan Sami should return to Pakistan first chance he gets because respect did not suit you there either.
Farid Ahmad
Karachi
After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjeet Singh reacted by expressing that he hates Pakistan and Pakistanis.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshaad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Bombay incident, there hateful statements have increased. The same people are now saying evil against the famous singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
after that the journalist removed his shoe and threw it towards Bush. president Bush expertly ducked before the shoe could hit and saved himself.
second shoe hit the American Flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
at this point, president Bush said that he didn't know why he had done so , Shoe was of number 10, I had no problem.
do you think this reaction of the journalist wasn't an expression of deprecation or President bush from the Iraqi people?
what would you say on this incident?
The tension between Pakistan and India's relations after the terrorism in Mumbai got further intense when the fighter planes from the Indian Air force violated the Pakistani airspace in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.
as a result of retaliation from Pak Air force, the Indian planes were forced to go back.

There are many problems faced the people in the world. It is not under the control of human beings.
I think it is mainly by people not think properly, what is the real cause.
The consequence of the fact that it is very dangerous to face the problems that arise in the world future.
Today itself start for the well beings of the people
What did the people seriously think about that?
Poverty, financial crisis, diseases are the main challenges that people going to face in the world in future.
Why did the people think about the consequences of the dangerous calamities affected the people?
Start today for that. Are you ready.

On this occasion, the Pakistani Ambassador to the United Nations, Abdullah Husain Harun and other senior embassy agents were present.
What do you say about the former martyr Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto receiving this award?
Samir
Chicago
It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jami Noor, Karachi, This news proves that disbelievers will only help disbelievers.
Until the metal of the axe has a grip attached to it till then it cannot chop off the wings.
And our leaders have a idea of this therefore they are using it to make secret plans.
God help our leaders.
The Security Council panel of the United Nations have included the name of Hafiz Sa'eed as well as two other Pakistani citizens and that of Jama'athud Da'wah as well as four other organisations into the list of terrorists.
The Pakistanis whose names were included in the terrorist list by the Al-Qaidah and Taliban Sanctions Committee of the Security Council included Jama'athud Da'ah chief, Hafiz Mohammad Saeed, practically non-existent organisation Lashkar-e-Taiba Operation Chief, Zakiur Rahman Lakhwi and Financial Chief Haji Mohammad Ashraf.
Apart from this, a saudi national, Mahmood Ahmad Bazek was also included in the list of terrorists.
Among the organisations were Jama'athud Da'wah, Pasban Kashmir, ArRasheed trust, and Al-Akhtar trust International.
The member countries will immediately freeze all the assets of these individuals and organisations, they will be restricted from traveling and will be under arrest.
They will have to face cases.
These regulations are not as a result of Indian influence, are they?
Why is India blaming these parties for the Bombay attacks without any proof?
Aren't there any terrorist groups in India?
Are International groups not aware of the tortures being done on the minorities in India?
Please inform us with your suggestions.
