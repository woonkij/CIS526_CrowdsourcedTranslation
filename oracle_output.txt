Thomas Reid, who worked in the Leur National Laboratory as a weapon designer had written this book with the help of Los Alamos National Laboratory's former Technical Intelligence Director, Danny Staleman.
this book was titled, 'Nuclear Express: political history of bomb and its proliferation' and both writers have claimed that which ever country first made a nuclear bomb either stole the nuclear secrets of another country or they had the support of another nuclear power.
Thomas Reid said in an interview with US News, that China tested Pakistan's first atom bomb in 1990, during the term of the Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto.
Thomas Reid said that based to many reasons, he has a belief that China had experimented Pakistan's first nuclear bomb.
the reasons include the design of the bomb and some information retrieved during talks with the Chinese scientists.

He added that the atom bomb that was tested on May 19th 1998 by Pakistan was made very carefully and that Pakistani scientists had complete reliance on it.
When Thomas Reid was asked whether China provided nuclear technology to Pakistan, he said because India was the common enemy of both China and Pakistan.
He said that there was proof available that Dr. Abdul Qadeer Khan used the Chinese design, and later on the documents which were received from Libya also verify this fact.
Upon another question, as to whether joint nuclear testing was common, he said that America had openly performed nuclear tests for England in the deserts of Nevada in 1990.
He said that we guess that too that Israel was given access to the results of this test.
Thomas Reeds was also asked if China is continuing nuclear proliferation?
Upon that Thomas Reid said that China has been providing raw material, guidance and design for the nuclear setup in Asfahan, Iran since 1991.

The role of European Union for the peace in Middle East
from official point of view, the role of European Union is decisive in the peace efforts to stop the war in the Middle East.
According to the official stand of Brussels, Schwarzenberg delegation or efforts of Sarkozy are helping hands in this process.
The spokesperson of the European Commission, Amadeu Altafaj, said that every effort which helps advancing the joint message of the European Union to the two parties, is welcome.
it seems alright as far as the official statement is concerned.
but in reality the European Union is portraying a very disappointing picture of the internal tensions.
The role of Czech Republic as the President of the Union is already weak
an on top of that the internal issues have made is helpless.
on the other hand the French president Sarkozy is behaving like if he is still the president of the European Union.
Whereas France has completed its presidential tenure of six months.
Sarkozy wants to play a leading role and he is capable of it but he does not have the permission to do it.
the most funny situation is faced by the French foreign minister Bernard Kouchner.
He is in the delegation which is led by Schwarzenberg the Foreign Minister of Czech Republic.
In addition to that, the two foreign ministers are giving different statements on the war in Middle East.
Schwarzenberg says that Israel has the right for self defense whereas Kouchner says that this cannot be considered as a war for self defense. moreover Germany has sent its special ambassador to Middle East. Unless the European Union does not show unity based on common stance, it can not succeed on the diplomatic front.
its proof is the Israeli behavior which does not care about the efforts for reconciliation from the European Union.
this is a golden chance for the European Union to do something since America due to the policies of George W. Bush has already failed in the Middle East.
Financial crisis: German millionaire industrialist's suicide
Adolf Merckle, a resident of Sawabia in Southern Germany left a huge business group behind him.
but a short while ago, common German citizens did not know much about it.
when he had to negotiate with 30 banks who lent money to his industrial group, he became the topic of the headlines and he could foresee the murky future of the Merckle group.
The Merkle group had to face a loss of a few hundred million Euros due to the arrival of the financial crisis after it bought shares in the German car manufacturing company, Volkswagen.
then the financial institutes rejected to provide the much needed 100 Million and 1 billion euros to this group and this exerted severe pressure on Marclay.
Some time back the bank agreed to provide Merkel Group an emergency loan but Adolf Merkel who raised from a small industrialist to the position of a strong industrial group whose annual income was approximately 30 billion Euro, could not bare the loss in his investment capability.
After the death of his father, when Adolf Merkel took over his family business, he developed it quick, putting it on new lines.
He called his company Ratiopharm, which is a very successful and large pharmaceutical company in Germany.
Until a while ago, the value of this business was between 5 and 6 billion Euros, and it still earns about 8.1 billion Euros a year.After the superb success of Ratiopharm, Merkel group started buying many other institutions which included construction supply manufacturing companies like Hydelburg Cement to car manufacturing companies like Kassbohrer.
The number of employees of the Merkel group around the world is near 100,000 and its foundation company, the pharmaceutical Ratiopharm always had special importance.
Adolf Merkel has said many times in his life: "It has been four generations since I started making medicine.
Now the management of this group is in the hands of my children and I hope that the mangement of this company will remain in my family for a few hundred years.
After the suicide of Adolf Marclay,the banks have given approval of temporary loan of 400 million euro for his group VEM but on this condition that VEM have to be sold to Rasio Farm so that the financial position of this group is improved on long term basis.
Like this, after the death of Adolf Meerklay, the Meerklay group will not remain the same as it was.

Herrmann said that from 2010 his state will keep this fact in mind while collecting the data of criminals.
Besides Baweria, Hamburg is also thinking in the same lines.

Ahlhaus presented an analysis report of provincial office of crime management prepared in 2006, according to which in the Bergdorf area of Hemberg the percentage of foreigners in the crimes committed there was calculated.
results showed that the foreigners here have
crime rate is less then the crimes committed in the whole province.
In contrast to this calculation, when in 2006 in Berlin, the teenage crime rates were analyzed, it was found that the teenagers having a foreign background was 7.44%
.7 percent.
However, the various German political parties such as SPD, environmentalist party, grains, and left wing party Linkspartei is against finding out during the collecting of crime statistics, as to which German citizen is of foreign background.

In this regard President Obama has instructed to plan for withdrawal of American Army from Iraq, whereas today American President will sign the order of closing of notorious Guantanamo be Prison.
It is expected that President Barack Obama is about to sign an order by which Guantanamo be Prison will be closed within a year.
Apart from this, the White House is expected to revise suspected terrorism investigation methods and ban ill treatment of prisoners during interrogation.
President Barack Obama started to fulfill his election campaign promises from his first day in office, and first of all started by taking steps towards making the actions and working of the government transparent.
Experts say that the American president has started making efforts to save the falling image of America throughout the world, but that would be difficult for it, because as long as it will keep supporting the blood thirsty Israeli government, it can not be expected to do anything good. Therefore if America wants to save its image, it will have to stop its support of Israel and have to disassociate itself from Israel's crimes.

who drink at least three cups of tea a day, is reduced by up to 37%.
It is also told in the research that it does not help older women even if they drink three or more cups of tea daily.
Experts believe that the reason for this is that tea has such ingredients in it, which are more effective against specific tumors which generally occur in women below the age of 50.
In Moffitt Cancer Center, in the city of Tampa, Florida state, a research was conducted on over 5000 women, who had undergone treatment for breast cancer.

Experts compared their medical records and lifestyles with women who were safe from breast cancer.
the experts also found out that on a particular type of cancer, Lobular, tea had shown a great effect and it reduced by 66 percent.
almost every tenth patient of breast cancer suffers from this type of it.
this type of cancer is more dangerous because it deep inside and is usually diagnosed when it has already spread to a great extent.
Experts say that regular tea consumption, at least three cups a day, can drastically reduce the occurrence of breast cancer in young women.

why reduce exercise with the age?
New Research
Exercise is good for health in any age.
it energizes your heart, reduces the cholesterol level, helps in keeping the weight low, helps in preventing diabetes and slows down the process of Alzheimer or dementia.
Unfortunately, with many people with increasing age reduces the ability to exercise.
experts say that exercise keep our body and brain active however age can affect it.
The American Medical Association says that Many health problems can occur if exercise is not carried out.
Dr. Patricia Palecca of Mayo Clinic, Minnesota says that an increase in age is a major cause of inability to excercise and lack of bodily activity.
Dr. Patricia teaches medicine at Mayo Clinic.
She headed a research regarding heart diseases and man's ability to do exercise in older age.
Team of doctors used high frequency sound waves to observe the performance of heart.
In which the pumping of the blood by the heart, its contraction and relaxation was studied.
Researches focused their attention on the right side of the heart, which is the main part of pumping blood.
They discovered that with increase in age, the problems in the rate of heart relaxation also increase.
Dr. Patricia says that with increase in age, the problems in the heart relaxation rates increases and thus effects the ability to exercise with growing age.
Dr. Garwin Cain was also a part of this study.
He says that we were surprised to see that there is a definite effect of this. And this clearly proves how deep a relation the worsening of exercise has with the relaxation of the heart.
Sometimes blood pressure can cause faults in the working of the heart and can become a cause of heart diseases.
If doctors and patients can work together when it comes to heart diseases, then they can enjoy the benefits of exercise even with older age.
A detailed report has been published in the Journal of American Medical Association.
No chances of an immediate war with Pakistan: Indian Army chief
The chief of the Indian Army, General Deepak Kapoor has stated that there are no chances of immediate war with Pakistan. However, to serve the country and protect its interests, they are always ready.
General Kapoor has made the accusation, that despite ascertainments and the international pressure on Pakistan due to the Mumbai attacks, in his words, the terrorists structure is not only just the same in Pakistan, but it is also active.
he said this while talking to the correspondents in Srinagar.
The Indian Army Chief was on a one day tour to the valley of Kashmir in order to analyze the overall security situation in New Delhi administered Kashmir and preparation of armed forces on the borders.
He was asked a question, that according to the media reports Pakistan has rejected the evidence provided from India regarding the Mumbai attacks, what were his thoughts about it.

May Allah bless the tongues of the world and may Barack become a blessing for the world.
Though there is not much hope, but we shall see how the relationship between America and Pakistan , effected by this change, are in our favor.
And what Barack Obama, who is the result of Martin Luther Kings dreams, gives to the world.
Obama, part of whose name is Husain, taking the oath today, as the American President, is not only a matter of all sorts of historic importance, but also a historic test.
Not only for his own self but also for those who supported him with all their hearts.
This will also be a test for white people majority as it is not easy for them to accept heartily the presidency of black on them.
Those here in South Asia, especially the Muslims, who have hopes about him, should remember that he was elected the president of America, and Obama should remember that the president of America is actually the president of the world.
After a moment, a man whose brothers and sisters from his generation were brought to America from their countries as slaves and whose sweat and blood have strengthened the roots of the most powerful country of the new era, today a representative of this racially discrete nation will be called the 40th President of this very America.
Many people have expectations from this one man.
It is necessary for people who likes him not to have over expectations from him.
If Obama is even successful in somewhat reducing the hate that is spread on lineage and religion based lines, it will be a victory for his admirers.
What will be its effect on South Asia and can a meaningful change be expected in the American policy regarding this matter?
How will this change effect the relationship between America and Pakistan.

My Sir, whether it be Obama or someone else, the type of policies with regards to the whole world is decided by the multi-billionaire, influential, strong Jewish lobby.
And as far as Pakistan is concerned, after the series of recent Bombay blasts,the offensive reaction of India, America and Israel is in front of everyone.
After the creation of Pakistan, the administration of Swat remained with the Ruler of Swat, who had a regular Army and Law.
With a help of an agreement they transferred the administration of Swat to the Pakistan government.
But it's sad that our governments have treated Swat like a step mother.
There was no increase in the number of schools after the end of the government of the ruler of Swat.
Nor was there any interest in the construction and development over there.
The girls who are getting education today are much lesser in number than those who used to get educated in the previous era.
Targeting of educational institutes is continued by local Talibans in NWFP Province of Pakistan.
The maximum number of schools have been destroyed in district Swat in which majority are the girls schools.
And not just that, the Taliban have also announced a ban on education for girls.
Thousands of boy and girl students are being deprived of education.
what do you think, by stopping girls' education, what the Taliban want to achieve?
why has the government failed to stop these illegal activities so far.
In your opinion what government should do.
The question should be, what does the ISI and Pakistani agencies get?
because the people of Swat have now understood this game that the army is there to serve the Taliban and not to kill them, otherwise how can five schools be bombed in a single night and that during the Curfew. How come people can be beheaded during the curfew and hanged in the center of the crossing.
When the government is not being allowed to have any say in Swat, how can the government be successful in stopping these illegal steps?
now the question arises that having an armed force, armed with modern weapons, modern technologies and intelligence system, why the government can not control these few Taliban.
The only answer is that they are supported by some unseen power that neither their weapons finish nor they get caught.
The conclusion is that the Taliban, through there dark activities is making the work of the global leadership easier.
15 years ago, the war was on in Afghanistan.
ISI used to control the Taliban when there was the opposition from the Northern Alliance, which was supported by Russia, India and Iran.
Then, suddenly the situation changed and Taliban's works came to light.
And ISI also got an offer of Dollars from America, so the previous friend became an enemy.
Now the scenario is that the war is still raging but the supporters in Pakistan are still the same, Iran, India and Russia.
Until man realizes what is wrong and what is right, he continues to make mistakes.
As an example a thief when goes to steal if he at that time gets this thought that stealing is not a good thing and theft is a curse, there is also punishment in it and he fears from God then that Human will not steal.
Similarly, as long as Israel does not realize that it is doing wrong, and spilling the blood of the innocent, and it will receive punishment for that, it will continue to play Holi with the blood of the innocent people in Gaza.
Greetings!
The question is that, is war, armed resistance and terrorism the solution to problems?
If not, then what is the magic recipe that will bring out a solution to the problems?
This is true that war and extremism do not solve problems, but rather it puts 'blessings' in them.
Palestine, Afghanistan and Iraq should adopt the same model for their development, that Nelson Mandela had used in South Africa.
That means political and inner struggle are more important than armed struggle.
From the participation of Kashmiris in elections it can seen that they have accepted this point-of-view.
The Israeli attacks on Gaza still continue in the third week and the death toll have reached to one thousand.
In spite of international diplomatic efforts ,yet it did not reach to cease-fire.
According to an estimate,since the attacks started on 27 December to uptill now,90 thousand Palestinian left their homes and have been migrated to the safe areas.
Here, aid groups have accused Israel of being careless about Palestinian children, and said that a whole generation of Palestinian children will be victim of grave psychological and emotional difficulties.
What do you say?
What should be done?
How long lasting peace is possible in Gaza?

Taliban should be given a chance
Basit, Peshawar
Please wakeup, if the Taliban start doing the real Jihad, then who will kill the innocent people.
Who will burn down the girls' schools?
And kidnapping for ransom and if they do not get the ransom money, who will hang people on poles by claiming they were American spies?
These Taliban has damaged Islam so much that no other nation or religion has done.

Kohat, Pakistan
If the entire Muslim world gets together and even just warns Israel of attacking it, you will see how much Israel's daddy, America will get hurt.
And not only will their be immediate talks of ceasefire, there will also be an actual ceasefire.
but what can be done, where should our Muslim leaders bring the courage from.
someone tell Ahmed Nayad to take the first step as he is very popular for his bravery at the BBC forums.
The responsibility of establishing peace and human rights does not rest with the Arabs or the Muslims of the world alone but is the obligation of the entire world community to raise their voice against tyranny.
This dreadful incident is the worst amongst the crimes committed by Bush.
Similar to how, in Pakistan and India, on the 30th of June, that is before the close of the financial year, the government institutions are looted, in the same way, before the winding up of the American government, Israel was given the green signal to do whatever it wants.
on one hand America says that effort will be made for ceasefire.
On the other hand United Nations is passing resolution after resolution but practically both had been futile. This only concludes one idea that to oppress Muslims the United Nations is also a party to the Muslim oppression.
All Muslim countries should immediately end their membership in the United Nations, and should establish their own global organisation.
We have many examples of where only promises and resolutions of America and the United Nations are seen, but the harm is only done to the Muslims.
What is the use of this probaganda when BBC is not going to publish it.
Where have all the rules of journalism been buried? When blood, specifically of Muslims, is spilled, the monster of unbiasedness gets onto BBC's back.
which considers itself the standard bearer of truth.
Forget about breaking something on its own, the height of heartlessness is that it does not even publish comments
from the Muslims.
The only difference between you and the Jews is that they call themselves Jews and martyr the Muslims, and the likes of you stay among Muslims, call yourselves Muslims and cause Muslims..
[syja786]
Long time since, in the forums of BBC, a specific cult has been targeted sometimes in suicide attacks and sometimes in terrorism happening in India.
The most used word in these anti-Islamic comments is extremism.
You can get a very good idea, about who an extremist is, from the above discussion in which, writing against Iran was almost considered blasphemy.
When will our Muslims understand that Dajjal can not be fought with the sword?
Looking at unarmed people in the bombing of Israel, what shall one do other than crying?
But the most basic mistake behind this destruction and killing is that we try to use the name of Jihad to disfigure the beautiful face of Islam.
When majority of the Palestinians have accepted the existece of Israel, then what need does Hamas have to send rockets into Israel or conduct suicide attacks.
Attitude of the both the sides is against humanity.
The character played by America and United Nations again showed us their support for the cruelties of Israel.
May Allah allow the Muslim nation to unite. Amen.
And we should think about giving the real terrorists an anti-terrorism Nobel prize for their painstaking efforts against terrorism, as after all, they are doing the real work.
Otherwise, would it be possible for terrorism to take place at such a large scale without the support of some big leader? And everyone knows who is controlling the strings.
In easy words, such gangsters are told to do whatever they want.
The strong mans fist,it beats over the head and do not let one cry.
The Arab rulers are giving medicines for the injured,Funeral clothing's for the dead and money and they are asking
What should be done about Israeli attacks?
The actual problem is that the leaders of all the Muslim countries, including the Saudi king are in a deep sleep. They neither have an army nor any protective plans. They think they can support and fulfill their responsibility.
They should immediately take practical steps against the Israel
for example stopping the supplies of petrol to European countries and America but alas they
Greetings to all brothers and sisters!
I believe that in this time of difficulty, telling Hamas to stop their struggle for the sake of peace is an injustice to thousands of widows and hundreds of thousands orphans, and it is similar to considering them defeated.
If Israel and its supporters are at the height of their Pharoahism, soon Moses will be born within their house, as this is the rule of nature, as the steps taken by America and Israel have acted like a fertilizer in growing suicide bombers among the Muslims.
they can can not understand who are blind in trance of power.
Abu Abdullah, Pakistan
Hamas and Israel should reconcile so that this bloodshed comes to an end.
Mohammad Sarfraz, Paris, France
Absolutely correctly stated
Supposing that Hamas is 100% on the truth, and they are struggling against oppression, to become successful in the eyes of Allah. Even then, they should know that if a good deed is resulting in the destruction of an established house, it is no more a good deed.
those who claim to love God, His Prophet(P.B.U.H) and their religion, to love humanity is part of their belief.
As if it is the order of Allah to evacuate all the people of the Book from the face of the earth, other than the Muslims.
Najeeb-ur-Rehman Psycho, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
No, not to kill them, but rather the order is to invite them to Islam.
but Jihad is ordered against those who do conspiracies against the religion.
One should fight with them until they finish their conspiracies. But this certainly does not mean that they can wear a jacket and blow up in a crowd.
brothers, the only end to the killer of innocent children is destruction.
but I ask my friends that the Israelis who did not have a place to shelter in past have become so strong today that they don't listen to any one, this is because the Jews are united.
They are not divided into Shiites and Sunnis but they are all Jews and have made progress in every field of life, built everything.
On the contrary, what is the condition of the 55 Islamic states?
They are behind in every field, and now the situation is that they have become so helpless that the enemy is killing them and they are waiting to die.
it is essential that all Muslim countries unite and prepare a strategy against Israel.
Feroz Magsi, Jhang, Pakistan
And there is no better action plan than this, to accept Israel and to learn modern science and developmental ways from it, and allow the world to live in peace and calm.
Muslims have a lot of land and resources.
There is need to be used properly.
this first most disappointing factor is that Hamas and Alfateh could not unite.
Great leaders like Yasir Arafat and Sheikh Yasin were killed in an organized manner in order to weaken this brave nation which is doing Jihad for the Aqsa Mosque and this was impossible without removing Yasin and Arafat from the way.
the world is witnessing that how Palestine had been scattering after the death of these two leaders.
and how the Jewish lobby gradually kept strengthening its grip.
In 1974 a Pakistani Prime Minister was of such an International trust that first time in history he united all the Muslim leaders under one roof with 100 percent attendance.
today on his 81st birthday, is it a very difficult task that the whole nation promise to not only keep unity in its lines
but by eliminating the differences between other Muslims will accomplish its (establishment of Islamic Common Wealth) incomplete mission.
This is a Jinn, which has entered Palestine for half a century.
This Jin has many mouths.
Many a times, this Jinn calls itself bad names from one of its other mouths to divert the attention and reduce the pressure of the world from it.
and its other mouths are eating humans in Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran and Pakistan.
this monster is most unhappy with Islam because it knows that whenever it will be kicked out that will be through Islam, Muslims, the perfect religion of Muslim and Practical Islam as the history tells that Islam has put giants like Abu Jehl on the right path.
The series of bombings of Gaza by Israeli war planes and missile strikes has been going on since the 27th of December.
more that 3 hundred Palestinians have been killed in these attacks.
after the Arial attacks, Israeli tanks and armed vehicles have reached the Gaza border with complete preparation for a ground attack.
The Security Council of the United Nations, through an agreed upon resolution passed in an emergency meeting, have demanded that Israeli and Palestinian authorities stop extremist activities immediately.
however the Israeli authorities say that they will continue operation in Gaza until they make sure that rocket attacks on Israel have stopped.
in your opinion, is this claim of Israel true that it's doing all this for defending the sovereignty of Israel?
is the world community playing its role in such situation?
does this aggression has an indirect relation with the coming elections in Israel?
Can there be any expectation of improvement in the Middle East situation, after newly elected president Barack Obama takes office?

Zaheer Chughtai
in this art now a days the Pakistani electronic and print media, specially some Urdu newspapers and columnists are no more behind anyone, who cheat in the coverage of the increasing extremism and terrorism or in the "grudge of Muavia" written on them.
At one side the United Nations, which apparently talks about human rights and peace, Muslims are wronged and tortured to their limits , but the United Nations only condemn Hammas attacks. For how long will they continue to have this two faced policies
Why there is so much atrocity on Muslims. If people like America leave backing up of Jews then Allah Almighty had said that this nation will live a shabby life and this nation can never live a right life. So if Americans you have courage then leave backing up of them and see then their fate of life.
The famous just people of the world and those that kill people in the name of peace should understand that peace will only be prevalent through administering justice, and not by being unjust and killing people.
If any tribe could be finished by killing their people, and if the required results could be obtained, then after Hitler's steps, not only the presence but the rise that the Jews are enjoying today, could not have been possible.
In the words of a poet
Atrocity is atrocity, it vanishes when it rises.
Blood is blood, that the more it falls, the more it gathers.
Now who will tell whom what is terrorism?
Is all this not included in terrorism? Why does everybody worry only about their own pain?
Are others not human? Or is it that the blood of Muslims has become so cheap? Was the blood of this many innocent not red?
And now why there is no condolence message coming from anywhere?
I watched the Mumbai attacks investigations like the fire was in my own home. I cannot watch this human suffering. Can't everyone else see this suffering? I wish Muslims all over could come together and think about this.
Dead bodies on the road, helpless injured and innocent faces soaked in blood, how shall we condemn, I can not find words!
I feel like crying over the helplessness of the Muslims that on one side people are being killed in India so the rest of the world comes over Pakistan without any proof and asks to perform operations otherwise we will do it ourselves!
And on the other side, Israel is ruthlessly killing Muslims and the whole world is silent. This is unbearable.
There is delay but not NEVER in the house of God and only then will this darkness shed. Then
In the presence of America, danger to the integrity of Israel is a joke.
As far as elections are concerned, it is not surprising that the people who are in power do such things to win the heart and mind of people especially in a state like Israel. And speaking of Barak Obama, history shows that no American president has wavered from the policy and will not do so in future. A tyrant is a tyrant whether he is white or black.
From the discussions going on in the forum, it seems that everyone is hurt over her death, but as a politician, her mistakes have not been ignored.
This issue is debatable, as to whether Benazir gave her life for democracy or for power.
If Democracy was her motto then why did not she come before American clearance and deal? Whey did she leave democracy under the control of Musharraf's dictatorship for 10 years?
Benazir did not come to Pakistan when people affected by dictatorship needed her. Unfortunately she came to Pakistan when she assured about government and that she will be freed from trails.
There is no one remaining to say about the criticism and accusations of a historical personality.
Sana Khan
Some things are ignored because nothing can be done about them.

Sir/Madam, maybe if you read not only the history of Pakistan, but of it's neighboring four countries, or of seven other countries, then you might understand the meaning of Mr. Psycho.

How merciless is our nation. We are blind when writing in favor of ourselves and our party but now when every historical intellectual is being blamed and critiqued, no one is saying a word.
We have progressed enough.
Sana Khan
few things are ignored just by thinking that nothing can be done of them. Just like a donkey can not become a scholar by just loading books over it.
although after the Mumbai attacks, there has been a setback in the dialog between Pakistan and India, however Pakistan and India should continue these dialogs.
If the talk is about war, then there will be many loss of human lives.
India says that the man caught in the Mumbai attacks is a Pakistani citizen and he has also written a letter to Pakistan in Urdu but on the other hand when India initially apprehended this extremist, they said he is a great engineer and afterwards he was declared as a 4th grader; point to be noted.
First of all, merry Christmas to Mr. Bhana and all christian friends of the forum.
Friends of the forum: Greetings Mr. Psycho, A. Raza, Sister Sana, Sister Shahida Akram and all.
We do not want the flames of war, we want the flowers of peace.
War itself is a problem.
What problems can war solve?
It will give fire and blood today.
Tomorrow will give hunger and necessity.
For this wise people
it is better that war keeps postponing.
in yours and ours yards
its better that the glim keeps lightened
Indo-American relations have now gotten quite deep, and India knows with certainty, that America will openly betray Pakistan, when the time comes.
this is also the old history of America.
Though in case of an attack by India, America will achieve her goals and the expenditure will all be that of India.
Pakistan should make a clear statement that we shall not attack first but if we are invaded then there will be no peace, reconciliation and ceasefire until India is completely destroyed or occupied even if we ourselves get destroyed in doing so.
this is the Islamic history.
even before this resolution the Pakistani public and army had given the message that they wanted to give.
In compensation for the Mumbai attacks, the abnormal diplomatic and military benefits that India tried to gain, made it more a victimizing party, than a victim. That is why, in contrast to the harsh initial global reactions, the world has now reduced their force on Pakistan.
The satisfaction expressed by the United Nations over Pakistani efforts and the praise by the Interpol leader of Pakistani efforts, in disregard of India's commotion, shows the side effect of India's more than necessary diplomatics.
there are no two opinions over this that it is a heinous act.
But the question is that when thousands of Taliban attacked the house of Pir Samiullah, where and what was the Pakistani army doing at that time?
Should the army not be accountable for what they have done over the past one year?
How many Taliban are killed by the thousands of shells fired by mortars and cannons everyday?
I appeal to the I.S.I that for God's sake, stop monitoring the Taliban and let us live in peace in our heavenly hometown Sawat.
And stop this fake Operation
The day is not far, when a resolution will be passed in the United Nations, against army intervention in Pakistan, in the same way as it was passed against Jama'athud-Da'wah.
Riaz Ahmad Farooqi
The extremists of our country and their supporters themselves are constantly providing all evidences and justifications required for instigation of action against them, and God forbid, the day when such a resolution is passed, in all likelihood not a single voice would be raised in United Nations, in our favour.
And supposing the passing of such a resolution is delayed,some other strength will definitely leave our aid to ourself,, keeping the example of America in front of them.
We are not aware and familiar with the character and achievements of Pir Sami-ullah and what his activities were.
Perhaps he was not a revolutionist.
As the bodies of Comrade Che Guevara, Nawab Akbar Khan Bagti, Dr. Najibullah and thousands of other revolutionists were dishonored at the hands of the enemy.
They are immortal even after they die.
But there is an international game being played over here. Here, they are ruling by scaring the public about beastliness and terror.
So that license can be created that if we are not here than these ferocious and barbaric will clutch the government.
In the name of religion, activities of these so called Islam lovers is highly condemned.
These supporters of extremists can see the injustice of America but instead of expressing grieve on those dishonest acts they clearly shun them by giving them name of tribal traditions.
Any person with a heart can never accept these beastly actions, which are done sometimes in the name of tribal traditions and sometimes in the name of Islam.
In my opinion, people of our army are with these people.
This is because, when these people move around, at least some time will be taken. To catch them will only take so much time. But, forget about getting to that spot, even if they were there, they escape from there.
Are they so brave that they keep 50-70 people hostage and our army just watches it as spectators?
They are also the human beings and the army.
All in seeing that there is something wrong at the bottom.
Malaiyat. In the dictator of the age, Ziya-ul-Haqq's dictatorship, instead of presenting the Noble and Merciful characters of God, an atmosphere of religio-phobia was created by the use of many types of narrations of punishments and incidents apart from the incident of the body hanging. Even the literature and books like 'what will happen when we die?' created fear and terror.
And these people are using this fear and terror as a shield for the purpose of world power.
preachers!
Like you have scared the world from the fire of hell,
that you have yourself become the face of fear.
It is surprising when it is said that this can not be a work of a Muslim
We are either unaware of our own history, or we ignore it for some reason.
Upon the death of the Prophet, upon refusing to pledge alliegance, who burnt the door of the daughter of the Messenger and pulled her husband out with a rope around his neck?
Had they come from somewhere outside?
Was the attack on Medina by the the Army of Yazid and and the incident of Karbala was the conspiracy of Jews and Pagans?
Without accepting the facts, neither motives can be removed nor these can be corrected?
BBC people, stop this dual policy.
The better super hit title than this is: the beating of Bush with shoes is right or wrong?
'should have been
Tahir Choudhry, Japan
please show some modesty, a human pulled out of his grave and hanged over a pole just because he raised his voice against the oppression, and you are concerned about the topic of the box office.
the success of, operation Sherdil and across the border operation Lion heart, depends on the fact that in whose favor is the opinion of general public.
This step is of American and Pakistani intelligence agencies and Pir Sahib is the victim of this conspiracy
All the comments on this forum would be against the Taliban because intelligence agents have successfully infiltrated in the Taliban ranks and they are carrying out such actions that can change their perception of people.
I only want to ask that when this body was hanging for a whole day, what was the army doing? Are they only there for targeting the public. They even report something like this 'Bombing on Taliban residences, a shell falling on a house kills two children and their mother'.
Did they not know about this mistake?
Or were they watching the show?
We fold our hands and request them to please, for God's sake, stop this game.
After all, there is a ruler above you.
Whether the question asked by BBC is understandable or not, it is saddening to see the lack of perspective of the writer. For instance, no one asked what the army of 30,000, in Swat went there to do.
The helpers of the army were hanging on poles the dead bodies of those who fought Taliban.
Whatever the green footed Pakistani government did with the Swat public, the media, including BBC did not do good by keeping the world ignorant about the reality.
The Pakistani Army is putting up a drama.
Every child in Swat is saying that this is a bloody drama.
For God's sake stop this drama.
These Talibans have tarnished the Muslim image.
Through out the world if Muslims don't tell them Muslims then why would terrorists are found in their territories.
those who become insensitive and people who don't want to work hard take guns and join these groups
Islam has not came under the pressure of gun or sword
be ashamed
There is no allowance of this in any religion or family traditions.
All media including BBC gives thier views about taliban and tribal areas by different resources
But nobody knows what the actual situation is. It is we who know about it because we are tribals.
In short this is a game in which CIA, RAW, MUSAD, and our own ISI is involved.There is nothing like taliban or tribal people, they are the negative elements created by these institutions who are spoiling the name of Islam, Taliban, Religous institutes, Pukhtoon nation and Tribals.
The heads of Muslims have hung from shame over this action.
I salute MQM's Altaf Hussain and the leadership of ANP and PPP who speak against this cancer that is Taliban.
This cancer is a product of Zia-ul-Haq who died but also destroyed Pakistan.
But I am hopeful that current leadership will end this cancer.
After the Mumbai attacks, India had said that there was the hand of some Pakistani extremists behind the attack.
Pakistan refuted these claims and said that it would help India in investigation in every possible way.
India said that it has given a list to Pakistan that has 20 suspected extremists required by India.
Now, Pakistan said that the Jaish-e-Mohammad leader, who is included in the list, Moulana Mas'ood Azhar, is not under house arrest, and that the government of Pakistan has no information about him.
Previously, the President of Pakistan, Asif Ali Zardari had rejected the idea that western intelligence agencies and the Indian government had provided Pakistan proof about the Mumbai attacks.
President Zardari has said that it has not been proved that Ajmal Kasab is a Pakistani.
meanwhile, Prime Minister Manmohan Singh has warned Pakistan that its relation with India can not improve unless its land is being used for terrorism.
and in a latest development, the Indian cricket team has cancelled its tour to Pakistan.
Should these political events affect sports.
How do you see the future of Pakistan and India relations?
Neither America nor India will break Pakistan.
Pakistan will be broken by Pakistanis themselves.
what do you expect after so much provincialism, sectarianism, and Mullaism.
Time has proved that Jinnah did not do good to the Indian Muslims.
Yasmin, Chicago.
Madam, if we kep working on the vision of Jinnah, the cancer of Communalism, Regionalism and Vandalism would not have spread in Pakistan. And also the Muslims of India would not have been treated this way.
but it's our fault that we could not bring up a leader like his stature.
if we can not care for our heroes, then
This sector does have a lot of abilities.
god knows when we'll understand and the region will progress with the blessing of unity.
in both countries the enemies to peace like Mullas, Pandits, Taliban, Shiv sena, RSS have been raised.
And these negative forces do not want the sector to make any progress, hence the countries are kept on their toes.
Can you imagine with the aid of consensus between Pakistan, India and China what position they would have in the world.
Pakistan is under persecution from God that these thieves, bandits and criminals have been imposed as leaders of the nation.
May God our country Pakistan always be safed, ameen.
But,please open your eyes to look at the situation and ground realities around you then you will come to know that where American troops have reached .
Besides the country matters do not seems better.The circumstances in NWFP, Baluchistan,and the situation of Karachi in Sindh, are also in front of you .
in this situation the country needs such a leader who can unite us as one nation.
O Allah Have mercy on us
I think a last war is the only option.
Enough is enough.
now it should be do or die.
This problem will not solve with hypocrisy deceit.
And neither with small big terrorism in each other countries.
Afterall, even Europe was founded after the last world war.
and if this world war had not taken place, then these countries, just like Pakistan and India, would have been clattering.
Almost all of our political parties are agreed on the fact that terrorism and sectarianism should be rooted out of the country.
But our military leadership does not seem to be sincere in these regards. On the one hand, America and Europe are ascertained that we are with them in their war against terrorism, and on the other hand we secretly help the Taiban.
We have to think now and decide our direction and only choose one way. Thank you.
There is no doubt in this that majority of the members of Jamaat-ud-Dawa are the members of Lashker-e-Tayyaba, who joined the party named Jamaat-ud-Dawa Pakistan after Lashker-e-Tayyaba was invalidated.
Although these members preferred subsidiary activities and now after India's great persistence, The United Nation has invalidated it also and Government of Pakistan is continuing the crack down against them.
In my opinion, it is better if Jihadi groups leave religious extremism and continue religious and subsidiary activities.
The terrorist organizations present in Pakistan are employing professional criminals in the name of Jihad, the mentors of these and the mullahs are the same people who called Pakistan, Paleedistan and what not from time to time.
Now they are not leaving any stone unturned in destroying Pakistan.
Actually, these are not even fit to be called human beings, let alone 'Muslims'.
Without cleaning Pakistan of these mischief mongers, the national security will remain at risk.
Can we still think about whether or not to put a ban on these mischief mongers?
There is no place in this world for extremist mullahs whose only purpose is to kill.
Heart is breaking into pieces on this news.
What kind of world is this where it is hard to live for one who takes the name of one major pillar of Islam, religion of Allah.
Non-Muslims can kill Muslims, but if a Muslim even tries to extract revenge, along with the whole non-Muslim world, even the hypocrite leaders join and treat those who have sincere religious feeling in the manner our great leaders are treating Hafiz Saeed.
As a penalty of Mumbai attacks India.
Pakistan relations are affected, and the recent improvement of relations between two countries is enormously shocked.
India has always held the military and non-military groups in Pakistan responsible.
and is linking the establishment of normal relations with the action against these groups.
Whereas Indian security agencies have accused Lashkar-e-Taiba of being directly responsible for the Mumbai attacks.
In this case, name of Jamat-ud-Dawa has come in the front many times.
This is the first time that relation between both the countries have worsen due to a terrorist activity in India
In December 2001, after the attacks on Indian Parliament, these two neighbors were on the brink of war.
After that, Lashkar-e-Taiba was banned and it was included in the list of terrorist groups.
Now, it is being demanded that Jama'athud Da'wah, which according to security reports is just a new form of Lashkar-e-Taiba, also be banned.
In your opinion, should this group be banned or not?
Should Pakistan take decisive action against active extremist groups on her soil?
Can putting a ban on Jama'athud Da'wah help the present Indo-
Pak crisis to subside, and how important is it for permanent peace between the two countries that armed groups be dismantled?
Security Council of the United Nations has banned Jamat-ud-Dawa. After all what proof does the security council have to decide this so quickly?
Does the Security Council always show this type of urgency against the Muslims?
This is what they call a slow complainant and a fast witness.
India, itself has become a failed government!
whose intelligence, army and security institutes failed, and were forced to dance at the fingertips of a few terrorists for 72 hours. And India wants to put the blame for its inability on Pakistan, to fool the whole world.
When one disbeliever dies, there is hue and cry in the whole world. Why these double standards?
Countries only religious and non-political, Welfare Organization.
Furqan Farooq, Faisalabad
As long as our Prophet (PBUH), the Awliya Kiram and the Sufis continued to teach people the lesson of love and respect, the religion of Islam would spread and prosper with peace.
The Muslims have also progressed on war grounds.
But when this beautiful Religion rose to the hands of distillation then within the human beings began the difference of religious and disbeliever and the new gateways of pride and prejudice began to open by which the world was unknown before.
Salam- Please do it with pleasure but act at your own.
do not do it under American pressure.
if India is aggrieved, it should provide the evidence.
Why doesn't it give it?
Why do they blame everything on us?
there are extremist groups and organizations in India as well, why don't they put sanctions on them?
Are we the only terrorist in the whole world?
What is it that India is doing in Kashmir?
What is it that Israel is doing?
The truth is that we are the first Nuclear Islamic state in the world and that is the cause of all the hatred.
Pakistan is now in the last stages.
Kamranhassan, ABU DHABI
Your words touch the heart, and the situation seems so.
Now American magazines are very boldly printing the new map of Pakistan and all these sanctions seems to be the part of this conspiracy.
The Americans are not slowly but quickly strengthening their control over Pakistan.
We must remember that in these circumstances,if we as a nation does not display unity and solidarity then if Bangladesh can be created,anything else can also happen.
Terrorist attacks should be condemned to the maximum, whether they are on the Mumbai Hotel or the Marriot Hotel in Islamabad or in Palestine.
Similarly, terrorists should be hunted down irrespective of their nationality and whether they are Pakistani, Indian, American or Israeli.
Now the question is that why the whole world including the Pakistani officials are silent on the terrorist attacks that are conducted daily in Pakistan, resulting in the death of hundreds of people.
Wasn’t the attack on the Marriot Hotel an act of terrorism?
Then why?
Praise the worthy Advisor interior,Mister Rehman Malik,by the grace of God, how brave he has become!
According to BBC on one hand (a committee of) Security Council of UN has banned Jamat Aldawa, on the other hand Mr. Malik says we didn't impose the ban and if it is to be done will be after through research.
not only this, but according to BBC Mr. Malik has denied this impression with intensity that the arresting of the terrorists have been carried out under 'someones's pressure'.
Brother, Subhanallah!
whether having the ability or not or to say that I don't want.
We, the Pakistanis are fighting whose war.
and why we have our own interests which we shall do our best to protect.
No one has the right to interfere in any country's affairs.
Apparently colonial period does not seem to exist.
If people expect justice, or demand that an external united court be established, respect democratic institutions, and not help any dictator or army man, there will be peace in the third world, including Pakistan, which I think is not acceptable by those calling for unity.
As such, Pakistan is always following the goals set by Europe and America.
This happens, despite the opposition of a majority of the Pakistani population.
And this causes more opposing feelings.
And if America and its allied forces should leave Pakistan and believe in democracy, then the people will start supporting the soveriegnity by stopping their protest.
Pakistan has the ability to arm and disarm.
Security forces raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba in Pakistan administered Kashmir.
Since the Mumbai attacks, pressure is increasing on Pakistan to act against the extremist organizations.
India's accusation is that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved in the Mumbai attacks.
American Foreign Secretary Condolisa Rice asked Pakistani leadership to take practical measures for instant and transparent action against the responsible s of Mumbai attacks.
She says that no doubt the extremists responsible for Mumbai attacks used Pakistani soil.
In the meanwhile, officials in Peshawar claim that the lot of trucks which carry supplies to the united forces in Afghanistan was burnt by unidentified armed people, because of which more than 50 trucks were destroyed.
This is the second attack in Peshawar on NATO and American supplies in the last 48 hours.
During this Pakistan raid an alleged camp of banned Lashkr e Taiba and before this struggles has been made to unarm the armed groups from Karachi to Tribal areas including rewards on returning of the weapons and assurance of taking no action.
The situation is telling us that the efforts undertaken in the regime of General Ziyaul Haqq, after the previous Soviet Union's interference in Afghanistan to get rid of the armed groups that formed as a result of the resistance that started through American and Saudi funding, and to bring an environment similar to that before 1980 were not successful.
The question is does Pakistan want to do it?
Does Pakistan have the ability to do so?
What do you say?

I ask only one question from flag holders of humanity.
If you kill their children, will they come to garland you? It is impossible.
Saeed, Multan
And question from you that from islamic studies to western eastern studies, say any logic, argument and philosophy give permission to kill innocent civilians including praying men, laborers and poor workers of different occupations, in revenge of American attack?
If answer is in no then you have instant need of correcting your point of view.
People were armed, at that time their was a danger that Russia will turn toward Pakistan after Afghanistan, therefore people were armed.
Now when there is the danger of American attack via Afghanistan of which current American President clearly expressed in his presidential campaign then why should we disarm these people?
Only so that after defeating the American or Indian army, it does not have to face any resistance from the public?
Yes, if any of them is involved in sabotage activities then only Pakistan should take action against him.
But it is sad that the fact that Lashkar-e-Taiba is involved proves India's claim that Pakistan is guilty in this.
Najeeb ur rehman seiko, *Lahore* [P@KI$T@N]
Even if we accept that Lashkar-e-Taiba is guilty, it is still not correct to blame the Pakistani government.
And another question is that were these terrorists not supported by an Indian governmental or non-governmental agent?
Are terrorists only born or prepared in Pakistan, and not in any other country of the world?
as far as Laskaray Taiba has concerned they did not involve to this recent terror.
This should be kept in mind that Hafiz Saeed was the first Jihadi leader who claimed that the actions of Taliban were a Fitna.
this is my firm believe that Taliban acts was a part of American projects so that every that person and group need to clean out from the way who challenge Taliban in any manner.
Despite the cooperation of the whole nation action against Lashkr due to the pressure of India indicates the nervousness and flatterness of Zardari and Co.
To terminate the expedition started by the American and Saudi funding, they should be requested to clean up the mess which is poisoning our society.
One should also protest against them that according to what ethics, America and Saudi Arabia distributed dangerous weapons and named Jihadis but in the reality spread the virus of hateful literature and culture. Due to which slaughter houses were open in our country.
After the threat of attack from India, announcement of the Pakistani Army that they will divert their attention to India by removing the army from Afghanistan and the announcement of Taliban that they will take care of the Afghan border, America stumbled badly. And tried its best that India should attack Pakistan.
This exposed the might of the American Army in the region.
Although India neither made any threat of an attack nor she had the courage to do so.
And the rest was taken care of by the attacks of Taliban or American posts.
That proves that without the Pakistani Army and tha Pakistani government, America is nothing.
Karachi is the trade and financial center of Pakistan, and the Dubai of the backward regions.
Hundreds of thousands never return from here empty handed, but ever since the law and order situation in the western border regions was lost, all people diverted their attention here.
Now they are looking to kidnap this city.
For the first time, Pathans began to be called Pukhtons, and the people of a single town are made foreigners and are being made to fight, while the need is for unity.
One solution to this problem is that either the Urdu speaking people learn Pushtun or the Pushtun speaking people learn Urdu, or better yet, both learn English.
You will surely think this as a ridiculous suggestion but do you think that reason of this conflict is not ridiculous?
That reason of violence is language?
Zaheer Chughtai
Sir, I actually shared this proposal many times in my childhood with my friends, which included people from all religious and linguistic groups, but these people used to laugh at me.
At that time, the religious and linguistic hate, which was not as lively and strong as they are today, were still developing within.
Do not understand what and why is this happening?
Are these the signs of the Day of Judgement?
For what crime are innocent people being killed?
the reason is in front of everyone, ones who want to break Pakistan into pieces are active and those who do all this neither belong to any religion nor a country.
Whether it be Karachi or Mumbai, the house was burnt by the houses own lanterns
Whichever government comes, it only changes the names of the places and starts working for fame, just like how nowadays, the airports, roads and buildings are all Benazir.
Does Benazir mean that which is happening to the public of Karachi and Pakistan?
When Bombay attacks were at their peak, the failure of efforts of RA to initiate turmoil in Karachi proves this that in the past political elements working on the payroll of RA have now resigned from their posts.
unjustified killing of Pashto speaking hard workers and Indian threats have awaken sleeping Pakistanis from Karachi to Khyber.
The identical country loving reaction of all the political, religious, linguistic and national parties has not only taught India the manners of diplomacy but it has also given the American policy makers a chance to think again.
The responsible parties for the worsening situation in Karachi are the United and the ANP, and the government is taking sides.
Administration can control the situation in an hour but it is incited deliberately
The police and rangers are avoiding action because of the pressure on them by the political parties.
The talk of uniting is only restricted to speeches. The political parties should leave their interests and work for the interest of the common man.
As long as there will be political pressure on the government, more such incidents will take place. May Allah save Pakistan.
I think these people are the biggest terrorists.
and foreign powers are definitely involved in this but no one knows who they are?
And the sad thing is that if such a situation was prevalent in any border town, the government would take care of that place, but as this is far from the border, the government looks helpless.
the government should operate here and save a large and very important city of the country from terrorism
Otherwise Pakistan will face a huge financial crisis.
Even BBC Urdu is not writing the truth due to fear, and as for the local media, it is even thinner.
The whole truth is available on BBC English.
One solution to the problem is this that Urdu speaking people should learn Pashto or Pashto speaking people should learn Urdu or it is even better if everyone learns English.
You will obviously consider this suggestion as ridiculous but don't you think the reason for collision is ridiculous?
that language is the reason of violence?
There was another story of cruelness recorded in Karachi, terror of which was being felt by every citizen for a long time.
No one left any stone unturned, and the reports that surfaced in the media was 50% of what actually happened here in four days.
Last three nights were sleepless and are still afraid.
The people who killed the cobblers and peanut sellers who evacuated the hotel
The people who looted the super highway and cut the ears of innocent people are all unaware of Allah's punishment which can catch them anytime.
In your opinion, what are the reasons of this sudden disturbance?
(BBC)
Keeping in view, the gruesome bloodshed event in Mumbai, we do not need to delve deep into the matter to find the reason of disorder in Karachi. It is simple and easy to guess that the turmoil is just due to an unconcious trade of blood.
It is obvious that if someone mistreats the father, it is no surprise if the son becomes out of control.
The blood of Liyaqath Ali Khan and many other brave hearts was also from there. I am writing this poem to get rid of Saiko's misunderstanding.
We will also repeat the traditions of the elders
They gave their lives to build, we will give our lives to save.
Faizan Tauseef Siddiqui
it is very disappointing that whole country is at stake and we are fighting with each other.
Mr. Siddiqui, I request if wikipedia.
org is searched for Liaqat Ali Khan, you will know that he belonged to a noble Punjabi family of an area of Punjab Karnal.
Due to his services for Muhajirs, they consider him their leader.
Every action has a reaction.
One can bear ones self, but..
Ijaz Awan
Sir, before you gather a huge crowd very quickly, I should tell you that you are finding the open memento of the real gangster activities these days on the walls of Karachi in the form of wall chalking and posters.
We have been bearing both types of mischief.
Mischief mongers did not leave Pakistan or the founder of Pakistan. They did not have to face any reaction.
Contrary to that, they are pecking at the chest of Pakistan.
Only Muslim League (N) was left, she also handed over the draft of 18th amendment to Peoples Party.
Before this, MQM and Muslim League Q have made and submitted a draft of the 18th amendment in the National Assembly and the Senate.
Till now it seems that drafts of the 18th amendment is a political trick and no one is sincere in getting this amendment approved.
This is the reason why no one has made a fuss in the assembly or senate floor in the favor of this amendment nor has forced the assembly to approve this change.
It seems like that after submitting the drafts of 18th amendment, these parties have done their part that is they will be able to say this tomorrow that we submitted the draft, government speaker did not take any action.
MQM is i coalation with government, Muslim League(N) is secret partnership with government and Muslim League(Q) is the party that passed 17Th ammendment, then how it is possible that these parties are sincere in abolishing the 17Th Amendment
This is what is called getting credit for nothing.
Peoples Party anyway is not in a hurry to dismiss the seventeenth amendment.
How any one can think of getting his own hands cut.
as long as Zardari is the president, seventeenth amendment is not going to be cancelled.
This was the opinion of the majority in our survey and it is also true.
If 17th amendment was to be discarded then Zardari would have never become the president.
Now he is even more powerful than President Parvez Musharaf. Because with being the president, he is also the chairman of the People's Party.
as long as he is the president, the seventeenth amendment will remain intact.
in order to cancel the seventeenth amendment, the political parties will first have to dismiss president Zardari from the presidency.
Neither MQM wants it nor the other parties.
Most of the elders in our family belong to labor class.
And when we in our childhood we used to see our uncles doing strenuous labor it gave birth to this desire in our heart that God protects us from strenuous physical labor.
to avoid this we wrote a letter to the editor of the daily Amroz and asked him what should we do after matriculation so that we don't have to do labor work.
The editor wrote in reply to become a doctor or engineer and take such and such subjects.
From the beginning we were inclined toward engineering and also in metric we opted for technical drawing instead of biology.
but at the time of admission in F.Sc. my elder brother forced me to become a doctor after doing F.Sc. in medical.
We hardly studied biology for a month and when we couldn’t understand a thing we swapped biology for Mathematics.
means that the fear from labor work made me an engineer and now I am in a better position than my fellows in the family for which I am always thankful to God.
I remembered this when I was trying to lift the carpet of my old house along with my two young sons.
It was not half an hour since we started working, that the younger son said "Dad, it looks as if I was not made for this job"
We said if it is true then study hard like us and free yourself from physical labor.
The son said that I am studying and will continue studying, but I cannot do this work.
Anyway, the three of us finished that work in three hours and returned.
My purpose of saying this is that if a person has set a goal, whatever be the reason behind it, no one can stop him from achieving his goal.
But if you don’t even know what you have to do then God be with you.
It is said that do not say bad about the dead. But what shall we do, we see only bad things in Benazir even on her first death anniversary.
On one side Benazir crushed independence movement of Sikhs by handing over the list of Sikh freedom fighters to India for her own sake and on the other hand provided India an opportunity to fully concentrate in Kashmir after crushing the movement in Punjab.
Tug of war between Benazir and Nawaz Sharif rule is part of the history, which has pushed the country back many years.
During her exile Benazir continued to give negative statements on Kashmir and Atomic Program.
Benazir violated the London agreement with Nawaz Sharif and made a deal with General Musharaf.
Benazir allowed her husband to openly earn money, in her era, which is why he came to be known as Mr. Ten Percent.
In Benazir's era, her brother was killed, and his killer is still not been punished.
Despite being a woman, Benazir avoided fighting for women rights.
In a way similar to how Benazir did politics on her father's corpse, her widower husband is now doing politics on her corpse.
Benazir came into power twice but she could not punish her the culprits of her father's political murder even she couldn't register a case against them.
It has been thirty seven years since the separation of East Pakistan and look at the height of insensitivity of our people and rulers that neither did anyone mourn nor grieved over their mistakes on that day.
We should have been observing 16th December as a day of reflection, and made plans to prevent the re occurrence of such incidents.
on this day we could send greeting to the people of Bangladesh and try to bring them closer to ourselves again.
Rulers open the file of Mehmood-ul-Rehman Commission in order to study the reasons for the separation of East Pakistan.
They are making strategies to bring back the Beharis (ethnic class) stranded in Bangladesh and send them gifts to encourage them.
We have become so insensitive that if someone dies in our neighborhood, we are not even aware of it.
We do not care for our brothers and sisters because we have become selfish.
Even if a great accident occurs, we are busy in our daily routines of life from the next day.
If only East and West Pakistan could become one again, like East and West Germany became one.
We can be one again if we both sacrifice for each other and come out of the hole of selfishness.
But this wish does not look like it will be fulfilled in the near future.
When it was announced in the news today that the Governor of the American State Illinois was arrested for corruption charges
and that he would soon be brought to account for removal from Governorship by the state congress, an American white friend of mine, who had deep insight into the situation in Pakistan, he told us, showing off, look this is called democracy.
In America, even the higher level people can not transcendence the law.
And the other is your country, Pakistan, where even the President was chosen after the corruption charges against him were dropped.
My vein of loyalty throbbed and I said what is the big deal if a governor was arrested in America. In our Pakistan, once the Prime Minister was arrested and hanged overnight, and another time sent into exile.
Tell me, has it ever happened in America?
Pakistan awarded guard of honor and bid farewell from the president house who broke the law of the country. Tell me if anything like this has happened in America?
In Pakistan, the Chief Justice was suspended in such a way that besides the public support he has not be restored so far, did it ever happened in America?
In Pakistan, a fake-degree holder was made the Minister of Health. Did this happen in America?
By hearing this American laughed like mads and also accepted his defeat.
In this picture, President Zardari is smiling, despite being surrounded on all four sides by Americans.
It seems from his smile
He is thinking that America is supporting his government but he is forgetting that a year ago they were with Pervez Musharaf.
This picture has been taken as it was a family gathering
A photo like this was never published in the papers before; one president with three American officials.
It seems as if America's work in Pakistan has increased and now more than one agent was needed to complete it, or that they did not trust the new slave as they trusted the first one.
It is also possible that this was done keeping in mind the notoriety of President Zardari breaking his promises.
If it was a smart ruler, at least he would not have shown his teeth in this photo, and he would have at least seemed ashamed of the neckband of slavery that he was sporting.
If the principle of democracy is applied on this picture then Present Zardari is in minority.
According to democracy, the majority are the rulers of the country, and the photo is speaking for itself who that is?
Paradise-like Swat is also called the Switzerland of Pakistan.
till now, according to Government Policy, cross talks are also going along with the power use
But the use of force is not giving any benefit other than increasing the force of the Taliban and increasing the public favor for them.
What is needed of the government is to address the root cause of this menace instead of using force.
by eliminating the causes Fazlullah and Taliban will automatically finish.
the Sharia bill proposed by ANP will become the solution of the problems of Swat to a great extent.
But alongside the establishment of the Shariah, the government will also have to take care of economic problems.
from the early steps of General Musharaf, it looked like the nation has got rid of the incompetent politicians, but the lust of power changed all his plans.
Whatever expectations were, after joining the 'war of terror', he began to consider himself irremovable.
The expected actions and the steps arranged was end
as soon as Bush's era came close to an end he started worrying about the end of his rule and in that bewilderment, he made a deal with the thieves.
Even then, General Musharraf could have commanded the army, but the present government does not even know what is happening.
Whether in Bajod or Swat, the army cannot control terror, and instead they bomb the 'enemy', i.e. the public. Apart from loss of life and money, if they are making the 'enemy' psychologically ill, then we are the enemies, aren't we?
In Swat, the strongly affected part of Sarhad state, despite the continuity of military action for over one year, the situation is still going from bad to worse.
On the one side the governments writ in the area is restricted to the extent of just getting the condemnation resolution passed from the National Assembly and on the other side the effect of Taliban's unlawful radio is increasing everday in Swat.
On the third side the common folk consider it safe to listen to those who are in control of the area.
The security forces claim killing many extremists during Gunship Helicopter attacks and Artillery Bombardment but in spite of these killings the Taliban's has not only gained strength but according to estimate they have established their control over eighty percent of Swat.
As a result, on the one hand the government is not ready to accept defeat, and on the other hand the Taliban is stronger.
In between who got grinded, the poor citizens.
It is said in Swat, that someone asked what kind of people are the Taliban were, so he got the answer, 'They are very good, as they are protectors of the religion and they fight against the enemies of Allah and the religion'.
Then asked how is Army, the answer was that the Army is very good since they protect the country and they fight with the enemies of the country.
Then it was asked, who are the enemies of religion and country, the answer was "the citizens"
I am wondering how the Pakistani Army will fight the Indian Army, when they couldn't control a small faction of the Taliban.
They could not track the illegally set up FM channel of the Taliban, which I believe was very easy.
But still, the FM channel is spreading poison with all vigor.
After the girls schools, now boys schools are being destroyed.
Curfew is imposed so that tablibans can move around easily.
Tonight 8 trucks entered the suburbs of Mingora during curfew and created bunkers.
The question is that how could they reach there during curfew.
The army could kill Akbar Bugti in his house, but salutes the Taliban.
For God sake someone tells this Army to protect helpless people of Sawat from Taliban and prove that Pakistan army can overcome any enemy.
You say that mostly blood is spilled in the world because of religion. Tell me today, if there was no religion, would all this killing not take place?
Punjabi, Pathan, White and Blank, Mehsood and other tribes, are these the products of religion?
No, sir, no way! Only religion teaches that there is no black and white, there is no Punjabi and no immigrant. If it were not for religion, then half of the world would have been destroyed in fights between the white and the black, and the rest of the people would have drowned in tribe-brotherhood hatred.
Actually, only religion trains man's character and restricts him, as he has not come here on his own will, but rather the Creator of all that exists sent him here, and he must live here according to His commands.
As a Muslim, I am completely convinced that Islam is a complete way of life and the true religion.
After settling down in London, every morning I would first call my relatives and ask them how they were. Most of them had never called me to find out how I was doing, and I then realized that they do not like me calling them either, so I stopped calling them.
Living here in France, for two years, I also felt the same way.
I don't know why people always expect us to call them.
A resolution about Iraq, passed in a few hours, to send a 'peace' force to Darfur is not at all a problem.
Immediately criticizing the Mumbai attacks and restricting suspected groups is a matter of a few hours.
And where there is a matter of death, we are still holding meetings about that.
O upholders of world peace, life is finishing over here.
Is it for real that every one is waiting for its end?
so that any again no aggrieved could even think about using a weapon of mass destruction like the stonebow to gain his own rights.
When a father keeps running taking the dead body of his beloved son,even then you don't feel any pain in your heart?
If not then you don't even deserve to be called human being.
Rather you are a black spot on the name of humanity.
OK, this was proved that this area was also the home of the Israelis for thousands of years.
Ideally, these two tribes should have lived happily together with love and affection, but since their strings are in the hands of the western and Arab countries, therefore peace is not possible without their will.
and now even Iran wants to fight its proxy war from here.
Even if operations in Israel are stopped for the time being, they will start again after some other incident.
The interest of BBC's country is subject to the bestowing of America and Israel. And this is the reason why in the name of "enlightenment", they have come with a series of blogs based on "darkness" and doing one-way and a blind propaganda.
BBC is only carrying the 'formality' and its objective is to have sympathies!
mr moderator is requested that he may publish the commentry by this humble soul so that one can guess BBC still has some integrity left.
Thanks.
I don't know who wrote this story or how this story came to being, but one thing is for sure, in every age, draculas have been drinking the blood of innocent people.
In every age, wars have been fought and blood has been spilled.
But the surprising thing is that this 21st century man, who considers himself civilized, is quiet over this ruthless open massacre.
how can he not realize that whatever is happening is showing the ugliest face of humanity
The most disturbing and sad part, is what kind of picture will this dark side of cultured man present to another man coming in the next century.
Well wisher, Sajjad Alhasnain, Hyderabad, Deccan
At this time along with Dera Ghazi Khan, in whole country winter rains are goin on.
Presented is a poem according to the season. Enjoy the rain along with this poem.
It rains just because of you
whatever rains is the spring
When it stops there is no movement
sometimes comes without a reason
Sometimes it spread day and night.
sometimes very noisy and sometimes very quiet
These rains are also from you
in some remembrance some night
to a buried ash
Sometimes he put it out
Sometimes it burnt itself.
Sometimes every drop is like pain.
These rains are quite like you
All these leaders are about to run holding a very sensitive case, little do they care if the country survives or not.
Let the population sell toothpaste or clean the bells of the Mandir with the peels of lemons.
For one, our media is also corrupted, like our leaders.
It's goal is only to extract money from the government, and nothing else.
And as far as the population goes they can remain stupid because talking about them would be an even bigger stupidity.
Yesterday noon strange thing happened.
All together police running here and there but not ask on illegal parking
Moreover traffic nypd was also not in the mood to look at the illegally parked vehicles
it happened like this that a plane of US Air really became a plane and landed in Hudson river.
Till today only this much is known that the "terrorist" belonged to the family of birds called goose.
Yesterday was perhaps historic cold, in New York.
The temperature does not fall this much.
Pain started in my own jaw, after walking outside for half an hour .
Imagine that what would have happened to those people who jumped from plane in the river.
Happy news is that people all together stayed safe
And it was sad that the companies plane drowned during this financial crisis.
I went by West Side Highway to New Jersey, watching all this, and I saw that Southbound was blocked, but what did I still do?
Yes, I got stuck in the same rush on the way back.
Thankfully, in my one hour trip, the way had opened at least a bit, so I was able to get the 56th street exit.
Otherwise I did not avail the first two exit due to the long lanes of vehicles.
Makki, My Pakistan: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Ammar: Of course, believing women
Shaguftah: Well, Congratulations, Eid Mubarak to you too.
Sarah: I have had two chickens. It's a sacrifice. Janzeb will tell you how it was.
Apart from this, there is no other way.
At this farm, one has to get his own meat done,, including removing the skin.
Basam: Dot net could take a time to get right.
What happened on the forum?

To fight with the "listen to the blog", use Firefox.
Duffer: same to you, Eid Greetings to you.
Sir use Firefox
Snow will disappear.
we unnecessarily kept thinking of these Taliban of Swat as indelicate but who were only unhappy over women's education.
They were expressing this irritation by demolishing schools and colleges for women every day.
But like majority of the ideas, this was not proven right also. According to this news of CNN, on the lucky day of Monday, a group of Taliban demolished a Boys school with gunpowder.
South, taliban has demolished boys school
The girls schools were already destroyed, acting according to the famous English saying "Ladies First". I do not know why people are still bent on calling the Taliban uncultured and barbaric.
Another thing that becomes clear from this is that the accusation against the Taliban, that they are against girls education, is not true.
Rather, Masha Allah, they are against education altogether.
May Allah give these Mujahideen more power, and the evil government
which is let loose on us, may He help them in uprooting them.
Ameen Summa Ameen
By gods grace till now 182 schools have been demolished.
The custom of fixing marriages before birth among Muslims, marrying with the Qur'an to collect property, and the statement by many Muftis that the girl becomes intelligent and reaches puberty at the age of eight was not little, that there was the news from India, that a girl was married with a frog.
See a picture of the bride, taken at the marriage.
Some days go, a girl's marriage with a dog become fresh.
look at that groom.
humanity is still a rarity in the twenty first century.
Today is the age of computer and computer's interference is growing in every aspect of life.
Lots of people have many reservations about this growing interference of computer like in financial issues.
where use of credit card bring ease to life, it also gives better control to law enforcement agencies over your private life.
That now with just looking at the credit card transactions record your whereabouts can be traced.
and in future when use of real currency will reduce to a great extent, its benefits will increase more and more.
similarly in the world of crimes, instead of playing with the dangers of robbing a bank, the credit card information is stolen.
Similarly computer has provided means for friendship or networking.
, social networking websites like Orcet, Facebook and MySpace are ranked first in popularity.
But do you not think that the more we are following these social networking sites, the further we are getting from people in real life?
Similar are the match making websites, where your desires are matched with others desires and you are shown a list of the people who match with you.
Now can you spend your life with a person exactly like you ?
I can't do it, that is why a life partner is known as better half.
That she fulfill the un completions i have.
Perhaps I received a lesser share of wisdom.
Since childhood when ever an elder said anything to me that was the truth for me.
In the same way, I was convinced that my father knew the answer to every question in the world.
I was even ridiculed a lot on this
But only that saying seemed true which could be possible.
I was always perplexed at the need of telling a lie.
Bore loss on that saying even at this age
That is why I try to lie as less as possible.
that I do not falsely please others, that too with the name of Allah.
and Allah willing say only when there is pray to Allah that work completes.
As for the intentions, only Allah knows best.
This is a disgusting problem which is created due to reason of distance from religion.
According to both our religion and Pakistani law, young children should stay with their mothers.
Their father is responsible for their maintenance allowance and he can meet them.
Then when the kids become mature they can decide with whom they want to live.
You have mentioned correctly that the real problem is the relatives who poison the minds.
Possessiveness is present in all our actions.
Ever here this way of thinking is working that new co-sharers will be born in father's property and this is where the opposition is shown. Otherwise their father's this behavior is worth praise and pursuance.
here these restriction regarding making of relations have created many evils in the society.
The concept of the marriage of a divorced woman or a widow has become obscure.
due these unnecessary beliefs and tradition the family system is facing disarray.
in our society, if a wife of a 50 or 55 years old man dies or a husband of wife passes away and they remarry, then why it is not appreciated?
there is a Pakistani uncle near us whose wife died a good 10 or 12 years ago, now after getting all his children married when he married a widow, his own children have gone against him.
In my opinion, this is religious right, what do you say?
What type of mentality is the 'while we are there, no one can take our mother's place', kind of mentality?
In my opinion the children of this person should think that after having married all the kids, is there anything wrong in his marrying a widow?
Thereby, this widow also got support and the uncle also got someone to look after the house.
Because his children would certainly be busy in their worldly affairs and would not be having time for him.
The reason for this is ignorance.
Tomorrow if their wives refuse to look after them, when they are old, what will they do?
This is a result of the force of society.
When people begin to make fun of such a family for doing something like that, children start to feel ashamed of their father's second marriage.
Though they should face the environment and say that their father's action is in perfect accordance with Islam.
This is the curse of our society, which we are facing for the last 40-50 years.
Even a wife is agreed on the unethical activities of her husband but does not allow her for second marriage.
If she had the power She wont allow him of this even after her death.
She destroys her husband and her own hereafter, and becomes a cause for spreading filthiness in the society.
Nothing happens with singing about Islam. We actually like what our traditions and cultures are.
For instance keeping girls from gaining education and fearing marrying the girl of ones choice.
As for your question about the old man going to the widows house instead of bringing the widow to his house, so that the children could make some fuss and then become quiet and relax, (though the stomach of the widows children would hurt).
In the Indian subcontinent, we accepted Islam centuries ago but we could not let go of this illiterate thinking and always thought of culture and tradition as more valuable than Islam.
Thinking of a man's second marriage as an innovation, divorce as a clinical rest, divorced woman as untouchable, love marriage as a mark on honor and a man marrying a woman elder to him as a deception on the part of the wife, is all a part of this mentality.
And over all, by copying the western world, we are declaring the religious and veil as old fashioned.
It was easy to embrace Islam to get rid of such thinking is very difficult.
Allah grant us all spirit and courage for this.
Ameen.
Writing Urdu was never so difficult.

Ameer Taimur in his book "I am Taimur" writes I found the secret in my living time that if the commander of any army is present on the front line then that army will never be defeated.

if someone from common people dies then murder

When I was coming back to the shop after Isha prayer tonight, one man who was sitting in car, raised his hand and asked me to come.
I thought that probable this man has lost his way or wants to ask something, I stopped as his whole family was sitting in the car.
He asked whether I could understand Arabic well or not. I said no problem, tell me what you want.
He started to say that I have come from Riyadh, to Madinah, but someone has pick-pocketed me, so please help me out. I asked him to excuse me, as such an incident had taken place with me previously, that I had given the person 20 Riyals to buy petrol to reach Riyadh, but he went a little ahead and started to ask somebody else.
I got really angry and when I told him and threaten him of a cop, he vanished from there.
this is the situation of Muslims now that even for begging we ride our cars along with our families and make at least 2 to 3 thousand a day.
Whereas there is a clear Hadith of the Prophet (SAWS) that says that the upper hand is better than the lower hand; the lower hand being the begging hand and the upper hand being the giving one.
May Allah bless us and make us true Muslims (Amen)

Famous singer Adnan Sami's wife reached a police station in Mumbai, accusing him of torturing her.
, police has advised her to consult the court.
Adnan Sami's wife Saba Guladari submitted a plea against her husband that Adnan Sami tortures her continuously.
and treats her inhumanely.
Now this thing has gone out of her tolerance, therefore, a case may be registered against Adnan Sami.
, in place of filing case police asked her to consult the court by saying that this case is not under the jurisdiction of police.
In your opinion, is the accusation against Adnan Sami, by his wife proper?
Is it not an attempt of India to defame Adnan Sami?
Let us know about your opinion on this issue.
Adam Sanghar, Mehr.
As far as the allegations are concerned, anyone can levy them on any other person.
nothing more important than respect.
Whatever is the current state of relations between Adnan Sami and his wife, Adnan Sami left his respectable life and went to India to earn a fortune. The same fame has now importuned him.
This is the result of his own actions.
Washington...
top American officials say that president Obama will take strict stance over Afghan president Hamid Karzai.
In America's new policy for Afghanistan, instead of development, war has been given more importance.
officials say that Hamid Karzai is considered to be a hurdle in achievement of American goals Since in his government, there is corruption, drugs business has increased and Taliban are regaining their power.
The American officials also said that those people in the current administration who are pressurizing Hamid Karzai to do more include, Vice President Joe Biden and American Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan, Richard Holbrook
He said that this policy appeared after President Bush, who used to video conference with Hamid Karzai every two weeks, left. He used to stress upon the American role in rebuilding Afghanistan and its civilian institutions.
The Obama administration will work with provincial political leaders instead of the central government.
Officials say that they will emphasize Hamid Karzai on fighting against corruption
Hamid Karzai is facing fresh elections this year, and it is not yet clear whether Obama and his group will support Karzai for presidency or not.
Is this statement, of the American officials, a forecast of change in American policy regarding Afghanistan?
Is Hamid Karzai's rule coming to an end?
What is your opinion about this?
In a series of three one day matches between Sri Lanka and Pakistan, Sri Lanka defeated Pakistan 2-1.
In the first one day match Pakistan defeated SriLanka, however SriLanka won the remaining two matches.
In the third one day match, the national cricket team's performance was very poor. In reply to Sri Lanka's 309 runs, it only managed to hit 75 runs in 23 overs before going all out. As such, it had to face a humiliating loss.
the result of the series proves that the National team has no consistency in its performance.
besides the home ground and all claims, the national team was defeated, what are the reasons of this in your opinion?

Malik Babar Husain, Jeddah. It is very sad that even in todays modern age, such ignorant traditions are prevalent. If the landlord or the property owner targets innocent people with his harsh dictatorship, who will call them Muslims?
a Sardar should walk himself over these embers. why the present government do not act against them?
WHen will the court justice work?

Gulpham, London, publishes his own views and you also prefer these views. I wish you would also write some truth, and not change your words like Mukherjee, because the order is to speak the truth in front of a tyrant king, and this is equivalent to Jihad. What should be said of Mukherjee, he tries to change his statements and stay in the news.

It is all these people's doing Kashmiris are fighting war of independence for the past sixty years.
No, no one asked, now they are caught in war of extremism and terrorism so they have started talking about peace and settlement.
first they killed Muslims brutally now they are trying to resolve issues.
Anyway, Pakistan will have to understand their double edged policies.
Asad Khan, London.
India is creating such a situation that the world's attention can be diverted from Kashmir.
but Pakistan has always shown the real face of India to the world.
Now the British Government is also understanding that the Indians are taking cover from their occupation over Kashmir by blaming Pakistan of terrorism.
and they hesitate to talk to Pakistan over this issue.
British foreign minister David Milliband has said that by resolving the issue of Kashmir will bring an end to extremism, the government of Pakistan will effectively handle the threats rising on the borders.
It should be noted that recently the newly elected American President Obama has also expressed similar thoughts on the Kashmir issue
The British foreign minister while talking to media in Mumbai and has written in an article that the idea of the war against terror is wrong and killing people just for the threats to one self was the policy of president Bush.
David Miliband has said that Pakistan should show lineancy towards extremist groups.
due to the stress over the need for resolution of the Kashmir dispute from the major powers, isn't India trying to divert the attention from this issue by creating unrest in the region?
isn't the terrorism in Mumbai a part of this strategy?
Does India want to avoid the comprehensive talks by on the basis of terrorism?

I think the big powers do not want to harm Pakistan.
But are thinking of plans to keep it in their leash as they know that Pakistan is a nuclear power.
They want to create an environment of a revolution.
Foreign counties are thinking that if Pakistan is cornered that will pose more political and geographical problems. They want to help Pakistan and want to achieve their vested interests.
A citizen, USA.
It has always been a Hindu tradition, that in the side is a knife and on the mouth is Ram.
I think that they get problems often in a while and they start threatning Pakistan.
We are ready in all ways, the Indian Chief of Army should keep his mouth shut or else, we know how to give mouth breaking anwers.

Ras al Khaima, This conversation is going on due to American mischief. America's mind was already spoiled, but know India is also becoming like that. Let them attack, and they will see the reality, as to who is in how deep waters.
Israel is attacking Hamas, but no one has the courage to stop it. Watching Israel, India also wants to do all that.
The Prime Minister, Syed Raza Yusuf Geelani said that the newly elected American vice president, Joe Biden played an important role in removing the ex-president Musharraf's uniform and replacing it with a lame democracy, which is why the Pakistani government has honored him with a special star.
The credit for removing the uniform and replacing the democracy should not go to any political party. The Parliament is not a rubber stamp.
All decisions will be made in the parliament.
Prime minister said that the chapter of Doctor Qadeer has been closed

American President, George W. Bush, in his outgoing press conference advised newly elected President Barack Obama saying that he had made many mistakes in his presidency, and that Barack Obama should do whatever he feels is appropriate.
As the President I have taken steps according to the situation and the Constitution and under the law, given priority to the American interests on my popularity.
He said that the enemies of America are still planning to attack America, and that the biggest challenge for Barack Obama would be to stop those attacks.
He said that not being able to find weapons of mass destructions in Iraq was the biggest disappointment for him, and considering the Iraq mission to be complete was his biggest mistake.
Speaking at his last press conference at the White House, the American President said that this is my last press conference, and I thank the journalists and other friends who are present in the press conference.
Do you think Obama will not repeat the mistakes that Bush made?
don't you think bush was late in accepting his mistakes?
Will Obama be able to follow Bush's advice?

This is a sad calamity that Israeli is massacring the Palestinians and the same situation is prevalent in Kashmir, but there is no effect on the Security Council.
As many organizations who are in Palestine and Kashmir should continue their fight till freedom and by creating unity between themselves keep fighting every kind of aggression, one of these days their Martyr will bring result. By the will of Allah
Israeli air attacks are still continued on Gaza, hundreds of Palestinian men, women and children have been martyred.
Important political leader of Hamas Nazarian have been martyred with wife and kids.
Here the Security Council meeting concluded without any decision.
The condemning resolution presented by Libia and other Arab countries against Israel is facing American opposition in the meeting.
From the last few days there has been bombing by Israeli planes on the Palestinian civilian population.
The whole world cried out about the Mumbai issue, but the Israeli attacks do not seem a massacre to anyone including America and Britain.
Why the major countries of Muslim world are silent?
What do you want to say about this double standard of the world?
Saeed, New York.
I think the actual point that the majority of our nation in illetrate. They even dont know where their money is going to. Government is interested in applying taxes and fullfil their duties. Electricity and Gas shortage will remain same.
Because everyone knows about the character of those who have been elected by our own nation.
Crisis of electricity and gas all over Pakistan has become a critical state.
On the other side, there was an increase of an average of 18% in gas rates, while the unavailability of petrol in some cities has become a cause of great difficulty for the public.
Intense reactions, riots and torturous demonstration are continued in the industrial and business circles of Pakistan against the crisis of electricity and gas.
Industrialist have given an ultimatum before closing the factories.
Here there is growing anxiety among those dwelling in Karachi because of eight to ten hours electricity load shedding
Industrial activities have almost paralyzed.
Government Institutions are expressing their opinion by blaming each other.
Are the talks of increasing the prices of electricity and gas not a joke against the nation?
Why is attention not being paid to solve the problems.
Are the wheels of national development not seeming jammed to the government?
What immediate steps can you suggest to gain control over this crisis?
Let us know your opinion.
Imran Khokhar, Madina Munawwarah, I want to say that, as the people, the rulers.
I am surprised that a government claiming to be people’s friendly is unfriendly to the people.
The unavailability of electricity, gas and petrol has become a torture.
Government has no control over the institutions.
The law and order situation is worsening day by day. May Allah have mercy on the country.
A new year has begun.

The Indian cricket team was supposed to play three tests, five one day matches and one 20-20, during the tour of Pakistan.

Salman, Karachi.
Those people who feel proud of visiting India
and they make their films and videos over there, their eyes should open now, as to how much the people of India respect you.
I remember an interview of Adnan Sami in which he said that he is not Pakistani national but a British.
Adnan Sami needs that he should come to Pakistan at first opportunity because respect did not suited him even there.
Fareed Ahmad
Karachi
After the Mumbai attacks, the mode of the Indians have changed.
Jagjit Singh has showed his reaction in this way that he hates Pakistan and Pakistani.
It should be known that Adnan Sami has sung with Asha Bhonsle and how has he become helpless now? Adnan Sami should stay in India. There is no need for him to come here.
Muhammad Shamshad Alam
Karachi, On the statement of Jagjit Singh, I would only say that he changes color like a chameleon.
Who gives statements in relation to the circumstances. Pakistanis! open your eyes to how much value you are given in India. Understand their mentality.
After the Mumbai incident, their hateful statements have increased now they are spitting poison against popular singer Adnan Sami.
according to a foreign news agency, during his final visit to Iraq when American president Bush along with Iraqi president Noori Almaliki were in a press conference in his office, the situation went ludicrous when an Iraqi journalist while addressing President Bush said "You dog this is a farewell kiss"
After this, the journalist took his shoe off and threw it at Bush. President Bush ducked with expertise and saved himself from getting hit by the shoe.
The second shoe hit the American flag.
Security personnels dragged the journalist away from there.
On this occasion, President Bush said that he did not know why he did that, the shoe was of size ten, he was not bothered.
In your opinion, does this action of the journalist show the anger of the Iraqi public against President Bush.
What do you say about this incident?
After the terrorists attacks on Mumbai the tension between India and Pakistan relations worsen when fighter planes of Indian Air Force violated the air space limit of Pakistan in Lahore and Kashmir sectors.

This is the first of its kind incident in the current tensed situation.
Pakistan Air Force says that Air Force is fully vigilant to defend the country.
Information Minister Sherry Rahman says that Indian officials have accepted that aerial boundaries have been crossed. Although, this happened by mistake.
Pakistan military sources have declared this incident felonious.
Do you think India really intends to launch an air attack on Pakistan?
Is this statement of India correct that this violation was a mistake or this was to find out the ability of Pakistan Air force.
Not this incident will increase tension between the two countries?

Sameer

It is true that she was martyred, but we also remember how many innocent people she killed in Karachi, upon which she was proud that Nasirullah Babar did well.
But later, she changed totally.
It is also true that she ignored the senior members of her party, and made her son the representative of Peoples Party. What kind of democracy is that?
Jimmy Noor, Karachi, this news proved Quran that said that Non-believer will support only Non-Believer.
But until the iron ax is not fitted with a wooden handle, it cannot cut a wing.
Our rulers are just like this, that they are adopting secretive ways. This is why calamities are befalling the country.
May Allah guide our rulers.

Karachi, our leaders should understand this that people, they are doing the operation against, are the true valuers of Pakistan, who are tolerating all kinds of tortures but they love Pakistan.
If there would be war then they will fight for Pakistan.
When their love would be felt, just condenming politics will not work. I think between both, there might be going a resulting war.
