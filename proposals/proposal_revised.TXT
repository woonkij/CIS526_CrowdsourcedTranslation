Topic: Crowdsourcing translation


Problem definition:
For most statistical machine translation problems, one of the first difficult tasks that the researchers face is gathering the appropriate data. For instance, the parallel language corpus between two languages such as English and French, German, Italian, etc are relatively easy to gather; however, for rare languages, constructing the dataset is very costly and time-consuming.The idea of crowdsourcing translation is introduced to reduce the cost that may incur while employing professional translators; instead, the general idea is to hire many non-professional translators and use their data to start statistical machine translation research. However, it is really difficult to know the quality of non-professionals' translated sentences before manually checking it. Again, manually checking each translated sentence from non-professionals are costly too.

The goal of the term project is to:
For this project, we will design a homework assignment that will allow future students to learn about the benefits and challenges of crowdsourced translation through experimentation. Given a sentence corpus with multiple candidate translations generated by crowdsourcing, the goal will be to rank the sentences in each translation set from best to worst, without the use of reference sentences. Since many of the translations are expected to be imperfect, we must make decisions about which inaccuracies are more
acceptable than others. Evaluation will be based on comparison to ranks generated by a system which uses reference translations by experts.

Reference for the research topic:
The current project is inspired after discussing possible topics with Dr. Chris Callison-Burch. For that reason, the term project's reference will be mainly based on his and his colleagues' works in Crowdsourcing Translation. Additional materials will be utilized as we make further progress in the project.

Objective Functions:
- Sentences translated by professionals (reference sentencecs) are only available to the graders
- Graders are going to calculate the BLEU score using reference sentence against each possible non-professional translated sentences, and get a rank according to the sorted BLUE score.
- Let students come up with their own way to rank the non-professional translated sentences; and return their own rank.
- Given the grader's ranks, compute the edit distance of the students' ranks, that is, the minimum number of swaps needed to match the grader's ranks. Summing these over the entire test set will give the objective score.
- Student with the lowerst objective score will be the winner. 


What data will you use to train the system:
The data we will use for the term project is the same dataset used by Dr. Chris Callison-Burch (The Urdu-to-English 2009 NIST). 

=====================================
1. Description of the data:
- We have two types of data available (survey.tsv, translation.tsv). First data (survey.tstv) contains the identification string for each non-professional translators. For each identification string, there are features associated with it. For each identification string, the following information are given (whether English is a mother tongue; whether Urdu is a mother tongue; whether currently resides in India; whether currently resides in Pakistan; the years of speaking English; the years of speaking Urdu.) Using these features along with their identification string, the students can possibly utilize Machine Learning toward this assignment.

- Second data (translation.tsv) contains 





2. Scoring Function

3. Default System
- The default system is to always choose the first sentence in a set of candidate sentences. This would guarantee a consistency in choosing the default system. Since no information is used in choosing the corresponding solution for each sentence, it would not be too difficult for students to beat the default system.

5. Possible Extensions in bulletpoint
- Machine Learning approach solely using the information of each non-professional translators.
- Machine Learning approach; ensemble learning that utilizes the features of each non-professional translators and manually designed features for each sentence.
